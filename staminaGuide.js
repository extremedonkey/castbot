      `The map is a grid of locations you can move through horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Click **🗺️ Navigate** in your location channel to see compass directions and move.\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere, other players in that channel will see you. To hide your arrival message, click 🗺️ Navigate — the announcement disappears and you'll see your movement controls privately.`,
      `### \`\`\`📍 Location Actions\`\`\``,
      `Each channel has an **⚓ Anchor Message** at the top showing your location, a description, and buttons for things you can do there. All interactions are **private** — other players won't see what you clicked or what happened.`,
      `### \`\`\`📋 Player Menu\`\`\``,
      `Type **\`/menu\`** anywhere to access:\n• **🗺️ Navigate** — Movement controls (also available in location channels)\n• **⚓ Location** — View the anchor message privately\n• **⛵ Inventory** — See your items (usable items show a button)\n• **📜 Logs** — Your activity history\n• **🦁 Guide** — You're reading it!`

      `### \`\`\`⚡ Reading Your Stamina\`\`\``,
      `Your stamina is shown as \`⚡ 3/5\` — meaning **3 available** out of **5 maximum**.\n\n**Over Max** — Some items can push you *above* your max. \`⚡ 3/1\` means 3 moves available even though your max is 1. This is normal!\n\nThe regen timer starts from your **last** move. If you moved at 9:00 PM and regen is 12 hours, you can move again at 9:00 AM.`,

      `Stamina regenerates automatically — there's no button to press. It's calculated every time the game checks your stamina (when you try to move, use an item, etc.).`,
      `### \`\`\`⏰ Full Reset (Default)\`\`\``,
      `When you use your last stamina, a cooldown timer starts. After it expires, **all** your stamina resets to max at once.\n\n**Example** (max: 1, regen: 12hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 1/1  →  move  →  ⚡ 0/1  →  wait 12hr  →  ⚡ 1/1\n\`\`\`\n\n**Example** (max: 3, regen: 4hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 3/3 → move → ⚡ 2/3 → move → ⚡ 1/3 → move → ⚡ 0/3\n                                                    ↓\n                                              wait 4hr\n                                                    ↓\n                                               ⚡ 3/3\n\`\`\`\n-# The timer starts from your **last** stamina use, not your first.`,
      `### \`\`\`📈 Incremental (Attributes)\`\`\``,
      `Some hosts set up attributes (like HP or Mana) that regenerate gradually — gaining a fixed amount every interval instead of resetting to max.\n\n**Example** (HP, +10 every 30min):\n\`\`\`\n❤️ 60/100  →  30min  →  ❤️ 70/100  →  30min  →  ❤️ 80/100\n\`\`\``

      `Items can affect your stamina in two ways: **consumable boosts** (temporary) and **permanent boosts** (as long as you own the item).`,
      `### \`\`\`🍎 Consumable Items\`\`\``,
      `Using a consumable stamina item **adds** to your current stamina and **consumes** the item. It can push you above your max.\n\n**Example** — Energy Drink (+2 stamina):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 0/1  →  use Energy Drink  →  ⚡ 2/1\n\`\`\`\n-# Consumables do NOT reset your regen timer. If you were 5 minutes from a natural regen, it still happens.\n\n-# Over-max stamina works normally — each move costs 1, so \`2/1\` means 2 moves available.`,
      `### \`\`\`🐎 Permanent Items\`\`\``,
      `Some non-consumable items (like a Horse) increase your **maximum** stamina permanently while you own them. Each bonus point regenerates on its own independent timer.\n\n**Example** — Horse (+3 max stamina):\n\`\`\`\nBase:  ⚡ 1/1\nWith Horse: ⚡ 1/4  (max went from 1 → 4)\n\`\`\`\n-# If you lose the item, your max goes back down. Charges regen individually — you might see \`⚡ 2/4\` while some charges are still on cooldown.`,
      `### \`\`\`💡 Optimal Stamina Usage\`\`\``,
      `If you have a consumable stamina item, **don't use it immediately**. Wait for your natural regen to fire first, use that stamina, *then* pop the consumable. This minimises wasted cooldown time.\n\n**Example** (regen: 12hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 0/1 → wait 12hr → ⚡ 1/1 → move → ⚡ 0/1\n  → use consumable → ⚡ 1/1 → move → ⚡ 0/1\n\`\`\`\n-# If you use the consumable *before* your natural regen, you waste whatever time was left on the timer.`

Each stamina charge regenerates **independently** — so using one charge only puts *that* charge on cooldown.\n\n**Stacking**: Horse (+1) + Boots (+1) = max 3 (1 base + 2 from items)\n\n-# If the item is removed, max decreases automatically. Multiple permanent items stack.`,
