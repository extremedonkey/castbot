      `Welcome! Safari is a grid-based exploration game. Each location on the map is its own Discord channel — you occupy one at a time, exploring what's there before moving on.`,
      `### \`\`\`🗺️ The Map & Navigation\`\`\``,
      `The map is a grid of locations you can move through horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. To move, click **🗺️ Explore** in your location channel, then **Navigate** — you'll see a private compass with buttons for each direction.\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere, other players in that channel will see your arrival message. Click **Navigate** on it — the announcement disappears and you'll see your movement controls privately.`,
      `### \`\`\`📍 Location Actions\`\`\``,
      `Each location channel has a pinned message at the top showing where you are, a description, and buttons for things you can do there. All interactions are **private** — other players won't see what you clicked or what happened.`,
      `### \`\`\`📋 Player Menu\`\`\``,
      `Type **\`/menu\`** anywhere to access your menu. The buttons you see depend on what your host has enabled:\n• **🗺️ Safari Map** — Movement controls and map options\n• **🧰 Inventory** — See your items (usable items show a button — your host may rename this)\n• **🪙 Currency** — Check your balance\n• **📜 Logs** — Your activity history\n• **🦁 Guide** — You're reading it!\n\n-# You might also see **🏪 Stores**, **🛠️ Crafting**, or **🏃 Challenges** if your host uses those features.`

    content: [
      `Every move costs **1 stamina**. When you run out, you'll need to wait for it to regenerate before you can move again. Your host sets the regen time — it could be hours or minutes.`,
      `### \`\`\`⚡ Reading Your Stamina\`\`\``,
      `Your stamina is shown as \`⚡ 3/5\` — meaning **3 available** out of **5 maximum**.\n\n**Over Max** — Some items can push you *above* your max. \`⚡ 3/1\` means 3 moves available even though your max is 1. This is normal!\n\nThe regen countdown restarts from your **last** move. If you moved at 9:00 PM and regen is 12 hours, your next refill lands at 9:00 AM.\n\n-# In **📜 Logs**, your moves show a stamina tag: \`(⚡1/1 → 0/1 ♻️12hr)\` — stamina before → after, then time until your next regen (\`♻️MAX\` = full).`

    content: [
      `Stamina regenerates automatically — there's no button to press. It's calculated every time the game checks your stamina (when you try to move, use an item, etc.). Servers run one of two styles: **Full refill** or **Drip**.`,
      (cfg) => {
        const mins = cfg.regenerationMinutes;
        const time = mins % 60 === 0 && mins >= 60 ? `${mins / 60} hour${mins === 60 ? '' : 's'}` : `${mins} minutes`;
        const style = cfg.regenerationAmount != null

        return `-# **This server:** max ⚡ ${cfg.maxStamina} · cooldown ${time} · style: ${style}`;
      },
      `### \`\`\`⏰ Full Refill\`\`\``,
      `One cooldown after your **last** move, ALL your stamina resets to max at once.\n\n**Example** (max: 3, regen: 4hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 3/3 → move → ⚡ 2/3 → move → ⚡ 1/3 → move → ⚡ 0/3\n                                                    ↓\n                                              wait 4hr\n                                                    ↓\n                                               ⚡ 3/3\n\`\`\`\n-# The timer runs from your **last** stamina use, not your first — spreading moves out pushes the refill later.`,
      `### \`\`\`💧 Drip\`\`\``,
      `You have **ONE personal timer** (not one per point!). Each completed cooldown hands you a fixed amount, and **every move restarts the countdown**.\n\n**Example** (max: 3, +1 per 12hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 0/3 → wait 12hr → ⚡ 1/3 → move → ⚡ 0/3 → wait 12hr → ⚡ 1/3\n\`\`\`\n-# You do NOT get each point back separately 12hr after you spent it — filling an empty tank takes one full cooldown **per point**. Make your moves in bursts and the timer works for you, not against you.`,
      `### \`\`\`📈 Incremental (Attributes)\`\`\``,
      `Some hosts set up attributes (like HP or Mana) that regenerate gradually — gaining a fixed amount every interval instead of resetting to max.\n\n**Example** (HP, +10 every 30min):\n\`\`\`\n❤️ 60/100  →  30min  →  ❤️ 70/100  →  30min  →  ❤️ 80/100\n\`\`\``

  // Page 3: Items & Strategy
  {
    title: '🧪 Items & Strategy',
    subtitle: '-# Consumables, permanent items, and smart stamina usage',
    content: [
      `Items can affect your stamina in two ways: **consumable boosts** (instant, used up) and **permanent boosts** (a bigger tank while you own the item).`,
      `### \`\`\`🍎 Consumable Items\`\`\``,
      `Using a consumable stamina item **adds** to your current stamina instantly and **consumes** the item. It always counts — even at full — and can push you above your max.\n\n**Example** — Energy Drink (+2 stamina):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 0/1  →  use Energy Drink  →  ⚡ 2/1\n\`\`\`\n-# Consumables do NOT touch your regen timer. If you were 5 minutes from a natural regen, it still happens.\n\n-# Over-max stamina works normally — each move costs 1, so \`2/1\` means 2 moves available. But stamina above max won't regenerate until you spend back below max.`,
      `### \`\`\`🐎 Permanent Items\`\`\``,
      `Some non-consumable items (like a Horse) make your tank **bigger** while you own them — your maximum rises by the item's boost.\n\n**Example** — Horse (+3 max stamina):\n\`\`\`\nBase:  ⚡ 1/1\nWith Horse: ⚡ 1/4  (max went from 1 → 4)\n\`\`\`\n-# The extra capacity refills through the **normal cooldown** — same single timer as the rest of your stamina, no separate per-point timers. Lose the item and your max drops back; points above the new max stay spendable but won't regenerate until you're below max again.`,
      `### \`\`\`💡 Optimal Stamina Usage\`\`\``,
      `Two habits save you hours of cooldown:\n\n**1. Make your moves in bursts.** The regen countdown restarts from your last move, so spreading moves out delays your refills.\n\n**2. Natural stamina first, consumables second.** Wait for your regen to fire, spend it, *then* pop the consumable.\n\n**Example** (regen: 12hr):\n\`\`\`\n⚡ 0/1 → wait 12hr → ⚡ 1/1 → move → ⚡ 0/1\n  → use consumable → ⚡ 1/1 → move → ⚡ 0/1\n\`\`\`\n-# If you use the consumable *before* your natural regen, you waste whatever time was left on the timer.`

      `### \`\`\`♻️ How Regeneration Works\`\`\``,
      `Every player has **one** regen timer, anchored to their most recent move — moving restarts the countdown.\n\n**Full refill** (default): one cooldown after the player's LAST move, the whole tank snaps back to max. Easy to explain: *"you get everything back one cooldown after your last move."*\n\n**Drip**: each completed cooldown grants +Drip Amount. Filling an empty tank takes one cooldown per missing point.\n\n-# ⚠️ Players usually assume each point refills on its OWN timer — it doesn't. If you run Drip, tell them up front it's one shared timer, or expect "stamina is broken" reports.\n\nThe regen timer shows everywhere stamina appears: \`♻️MAX\` means fully charged, \`♻️2h 15m\` shows time until next regen.`

      `Items marked as **Consumable: Yes** with a **Stamina Boost** value will add stamina when a player uses them. The item is removed from their inventory.\n\n• Works even at full — stamina can go **above max** (e.g. \`5/1\` = 5 moves with max 1)\n• Using a consumable does **NOT** restart the regen timer\n• Moving on bonus stamina also doesn't trigger a cooldown\n\n-# This matters with long regen times. A player 5 minutes from regen who pops a consumable still gets their natural regen on time.`,
      `### \`\`\`🐎 Permanent Items\`\`\``,
      `Items marked as **Consumable: No** with a **Stamina Boost** value give the holder a **bigger tank** — their max rises by the boost while they own the item.\n\n**Example** — Horse (Stamina Boost: 1): player's max goes from 1 → 2. The extra capacity refills through your normal regeneration style — there are **no separate per-item timers**.\n\n**Stacking**: Horse (+1) + Boots (+1) = max 3 (1 base + 2 from items)\n\n-# If the item is removed, max decreases automatically; points above the new max stay spendable but won't regenerate until the player is below max again.`,
      `### \`\`\`⚠️ Over-Max Stamina\`\`\``,
