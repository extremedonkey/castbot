## Development Commands

### WSL Development Environment (Phase 1 - Active) ‚úÖ

**Note: This is a SOLO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - always work on main branch unless explicitly instructed otherwise.**

**Primary Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Once per development session (or when ngrok URL changes)
./dev-start.sh [optional-commit-message]
# ‚Üí Starts persistent ngrok daemon (stable URL across restarts)
# ‚Üí Handles git operations (safety net like start-and-push.ps1)
# ‚Üí Starts CastBot with pm2 for process management
# ‚Üí Shows Discord webhook URL for copy/paste

# Your new "Ctrl+C" - restart app anytime during development
./dev-restart.sh [optional-commit-message]  
# ‚Üí Git add, commit, push (preserves safety net)
# ‚Üí Restarts ONLY the app (ngrok URL unchanged)
# ‚Üí Use as much as you want - same muscle memory, better results

# Check status and get URLs anytime
./dev-status.sh
# ‚Üí Shows ngrok URL + Discord developer console link
# ‚Üí Shows pm2 app status
# ‚Üí Shows git status and recent commits

# Clean shutdown when done
./dev-stop.sh
# ‚Üí Stops pm2 app cleanly
# ‚Üí Leaves ngrok running (preserves URL for next session)
```

**Claude Code Integration:**
```bash
# Commands for Claude to use during development:
./dev-restart.sh           # Deploy changes after Claude modifications (ALWAYS USE THIS)
tail -f /tmp/castbot-dev.log # Monitor application logs  
./dev-status.sh            # Check complete environment status
```

**üö® IMPORTANT: Claude Development Protocol:**
- **ALWAYS restart the development service after making ANY code changes**
- **Use `./dev-restart.sh` to deploy changes immediately**  
- **Inform the user that dev has been restarted and they can test changes**
- **This ensures the user can immediately test changes without manual intervention**

**Benefits of WSL Setup:**
- ‚úÖ **Stable ngrok URL** - No more Discord console updates every restart
- ‚úÖ **Production tooling** - pm2 process management matches production
- ‚úÖ **Git safety net** - Automatic commit/push like start-and-push.ps1
- ‚úÖ **Claude integration** - I can restart your app after making changes
- ‚úÖ **Familiar workflow** - ./dev-restart.sh is your new Ctrl+C

### Development vs Production Deployment Comparison

| **Aspect** | **`./dev-start.sh` (Development)** | **`npm run deploy-remote-wsl` (Production)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Start local development environment | Deploy to remote production server |
| **Environment** | WSL (local machine) | AWS Lightsail (remote server) |
| **Execution** | Your local WSL environment | SSH commands to remote server |
| **Target** | Development bot (local testing) | Production bot (live Discord servers) |
| **Process Manager** | Direct `node app.js` (PID tracking) | `pm2` (castbot-pm process) |
| **Networking** | Local port 3000 via ngrok tunnel | Direct HTTPS on port 3000 |
| **Domain** | Static ngrok: `adapted-deeply-stag.ngrok-free.app` | Production domain on AWS |
| **Git Flow** | Local ‚Üí GitHub (push) | GitHub ‚Üí Remote (pull) |
| **Safety** | üü¢ Low risk (only affects testing) | üî¥ High risk (affects all Discord servers) |
| **Restart Speed** | ‚ö° ~3 seconds | ‚ö° ~5-10 seconds |
| **Backup** | ‚ùå None needed | ‚úÖ Timestamped backup before deployment |
| **Usage Pattern** | Multiple times daily during development | Infrequent major deployments |

**Key Principle**: Development optimized for fast iteration, Production optimized for stability and safety.

## Deployment Scripts Analysis & Evolution

### **üü¢ ACTIVE DEPLOYMENT TOOLING**

**Primary WSL Development Workflow:**
- `./dev-start.sh` - Complete development environment startup with static ngrok domain
- `./dev-restart.sh` - Quick restart with auto-commit and GitHub push ("new Ctrl+C")
- `./dev-status.sh` - Environment status monitoring (ngrok, app, git status)
- `./dev-stop.sh` - Clean shutdown with optional ngrok preservation

**WSL Production Deployment:**
- `npm run deploy-remote-wsl` - Full production deployment with risk indicators
- `npm run deploy-commands-wsl` - Commands-only deployment (faster, lower risk)
- `npm run deploy-remote-wsl-dry` - Safe preview of deployment changes
- `npm run logs-remote-wsl` - Remote log monitoring
- `npm run status-remote-wsl` - Production server status check
- `npm run ssh-test` - SSH connectivity verification

### **üì¶ DEPRECATED TOOLING (Cleaned Up June 2025)**

**Removed PowerShell Scripts:**
- ~~`start-and-push.ps1`~~ - Replaced by `dev-restart.sh`
- ~~`start-dev.ps1`~~ - Replaced by `dev-start.sh` 
- ~~`launch-terminals.ps1`~~ - Obsolete with WSL workflow
- ~~`deploy-remote.js`~~ - Replaced by `deploy-remote-wsl.js`

**Removed NPM Scripts:**
- ~~`npm run deploy-remote`~~ - Windows-based deployment (replaced by WSL variants)
- ~~`npm run logs-remote`~~ - Windows-based log viewing (replaced by WSL variant)
- ~~`npm run status-remote`~~ - Windows-based status (replaced by WSL variant)

### **üîÑ Evolution Timeline**

| **Phase** | **Period** | **Platform** | **Key Features** | **Status** |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | Pre-June 10 | PowerShell/Windows | Manual ngrok URLs, complex shell patterns | ‚ùå Deprecated |

| **Phase 3** | June 14+ | WSL Native | Risk indicators, SSH automation, auto-git-push | ‚úÖ Current |

**Current Philosophy:** Development optimized for fast iteration, Production optimized for stability and safety.

### Legacy PowerShell Development (Deprecated)
- `npm start` - Start the bot with app.js
- `npm run dev` - Start with nodemon for auto-restart during development
- `npm install` - Install dependencies

### Command Registration
- `npm run deploy-commands` - **Primary deployment script** - Auto-detects dev/prod environment and deploys appropriately
- `npm run clean-commands` - Clean up duplicate/broken commands only
- `npm run verify-commands` - Verify current command registration status
- `npm run register` - Legacy: Register global slash commands (use deploy-commands instead)
- `npm run registerguild` - Legacy: Register commands to dev guild only (use deploy-commands instead)
- `npm run deploy` - Legacy: Deploy commands (use deploy-commands instead)

### Environment-Specific Scripts
- `.\registerslashcommands.ps1` - PowerShell script for command registration
- `.\start-and-push.ps1` - Legacy PowerShell script for dev environment startup
- `.\start-dev.ps1` - **NEW** Complete automated dev startup script

### Development Environment Startup Workflow
**ONE-COMMAND startup for CastBot dev environment:**

```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```

**This script automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks if ngrok is running, starts it if needed (`ngrok http 3000`)
2. ‚úÖ Pushes any git changes to current branch
3. ‚úÖ Displays the Discord webhook URL ready for copy/paste
4. ‚úÖ Provides the Discord developer console link
5. ‚úÖ Starts the CastBot application

**Output format:**
```
üéØ DISCORD WEBHOOK URL (copy this):
https://[random-id].ngrok-free.app/interactions

üìù Update Discord webhook at:
https://discord.com/developers/applications/1328366050848411658/information
```

**Note**: ngrok URL changes each restart, but the script handles detection and provides easy copy/paste format.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**app.js** - Main application entry point using Express.js for Discord interactions webhook and Discord.js client for API operations. Handles slash command processing, dynamic castlist generation, emoji management, and comprehensive button interaction routing for both legacy and castlist2 systems. ‚úÖ FULLY OPTIMIZED with centralized error handling and performance improvements.

**castlistV2.js** - ‚úÖ **NEW** Discord Components V2 castlist implementation module. Provides modern, interactive castlist display with player cards, inline thumbnails, and intelligent pagination. Features dynamic component calculation, three-scenario system for 40-component limit handling, context-aware navigation, and user-first tribe ordering. Fully modular and expandable architecture.

**storage.js** - JSON-based data persistence layer managing player data, tribes, timezones, and pronouns per Discord guild. Uses `playerData.json` for storage with automatic migration support.

**commands.js** - Slash command definitions with environment-aware naming (dev_ prefix in development). Includes permission validation using Discord's permission bitfields. ‚úÖ UPDATED with `/castlist2` command definition.

**utils.js** - Discord API wrapper functions for making authenticated requests and installing global/guild commands.

### Optimization Infrastructure (‚úÖ ALL COMPLETE)

**errorHandler.js** - Centralized error handling and response management system. All 13 command handlers now use `executeWithErrorHandling` pattern.

**commandRegistry.js** - Command validation and utility functions for consistent command processing.

**config.js** - Centralized configuration management with environment detection.

**performanceMonitor.js** - Performance tracking utilities (ready for activation).

**applicationManager.js** - Complete application management system for prospective player recruitment. Handles application button creation, private channel generation, and configuration management. ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED with modular architecture for future expansion.

### Data Architecture

The bot stores guild-specific data in a nested JSON structure:
```
{
  "guildId": {
    "players": { "userId": { age, pronouns, timezone, ... }},
    "tribes": { "tribeName": { members, emoji, ... }},
    "timezones": { mapping of timezone roles },
    "pronounRoleIDs": [ array of pronoun role IDs ]
  }
}
```

### Key Features

**Dynamic Castlists (Legacy & Modern)** - Two castlist systems available:
- **Legacy `/castlist`**: Traditional Discord embeds with 25-field limit management and field-based player display
- **Modern `/castlist2`**: ‚úÖ **NEW** Discord Components V2 with inline thumbnails, player cards, unlimited tribe support, and intelligent pagination

**Components V2 Castlist Features** ‚úÖ:
- **Player Cards**: Individual Section components with inline avatar thumbnails and comprehensive player info
- **Dynamic Component Calculation**: Automatic handling of Discord's 40-component limit through three scenarios
- **Intelligent Pagination**: Tribe-level pagination with even distribution and context-aware navigation
- **User-First Ordering**: Shows user's tribes first in default castlists for improved UX
- **Performance Optimized**: 70-80% faster navigation through smart caching and reduced API calls
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized button layout and concise page indicators

**Role-Based Data Storage** - Uses Discord roles to track player metadata (pronouns, timezones) rather than separate databases, allowing hosts to manage data through Discord's native interface.

**Custom Emoji Management** - Automatically creates custom emojis from Discord avatars for each player in the castlist with cleanup on tribe removal.

**Reaction-Based Role Assignment** - User-friendly role selection through Discord reactions for pronouns and timezones.

**Multi-Environment Support** - Development mode uses ngrok for local testing with separate Discord application, production runs on AWS Lightsail with Let's Encrypt SSL.

**Specialized Game Modes** - Includes Tycoons game mode support with specialized role structures.

## Environment Configuration

### Required .env Variables
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_public_key
APP_ID=your_discord_application_id
DEV_GUILD_ID=development_server_id
PORT=3000
PRODUCTION=FALSE  # Set to TRUE for production
USE_COMPONENTS_V2=false  # Set to true to test Discord Components v2 for /apply_button
```

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses `dev_` command prefixes, ngrok tunneling, separate Discord app ID
- **Production**: Global commands, AWS Lightsail hosting, pm2 process management

### Production Deployment Process

**SSH Access and Remote Deployment:**
```bash
ssh castbot-lightsail               # Direct SSH connection to production server
npm run deploy-remote-dry-run       # Preview what deployment would do (SAFE)
npm run deploy-remote               # Full deployment (code + commands) [USE WITH CAUTION]
npm run deploy-commands-remote      # Commands only (faster) [USE WITH CAUTION]
npm run logs-remote                 # Monitor remote logs [USE WITH CAUTION]
npm run status-remote               # Check remote status [USE WITH CAUTION]
```

**SSH Configuration:**
- SSH alias `castbot-lightsail` configured for easy access
- Remote path: `/opt/bitnami/projects/castbot`
- User: `bitnami`
- **Windows users**: Use PowerShell commands for SSH setup
- Always test with `npm run deploy-remote-dry-run` first

**Manual Deployment Process:**
~~1. Stop bot: `pm2 stop castbot-pm`~~ Removed: approach below allows us to carefully restart as required. As soon as the restart happens, the bot will load up the newly deployed code, minimising outages for users (especially in case of issues)
2. Deploy commands: `npm run deploy-commands`
3. Restart: `pm2 restart castbot-pm`
4. Monitor: `pm2 logs castbot-pm`

## Data Migration

The bot includes migration support for multi-castlist functionality. When updating production, run migration scripts as needed before restarting the service.

**Technical Achievements:**
- Successfully handles Discord's 40-component limit through intelligent calculation
- Dynamic scenario switching based on tribe member counts
- Context-aware "Last Tribe/Page" vs "Next Tribe/Page" navigation
- Mobile-friendly design with page info in headers rather than buttons
- Infrastructure ready for future tribe ordering features (user-first display)

**Recent Fix: Menu Button Handler Routing ‚úÖ COMPLETE**
- **Issue**: Menu buttons were generating `show_castlist2_*` custom IDs but being intercepted by legacy `show_castlist` handler
- **Root Cause**: Button handler order in `app.js` - legacy handler condition `startsWith('show_castlist')` caught all `show_castlist2` buttons first
- **Solution**: Reordered handler conditions to check `show_castlist2` before `show_castlist`
- **Result**: Menu systems now properly route to modern castlist2 implementation
- **Impact**: Users get improved UX with Components V2 features when clicking menu buttons

## Emoji Management Enhancements ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Enhanced `/add_tribe` Command**
- **Conditional Emoji Generation**: New `show_player_emojis` parameter (default: true)
- **Behavior**: When set to `false`, skips emoji creation while still adding tribe to castlist
- **Use Case**: Allows testing `/castlist2` without hitting Discord emoji limits
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains existing behavior when parameter is omitted or set to `true`
