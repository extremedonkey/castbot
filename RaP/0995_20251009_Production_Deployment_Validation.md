## 🔍 Critical Changes Analysis

### 1. Cache Configuration (app.js:1349-1353)

**Before** (Production):
```javascript
makeCache: Options.cacheWithLimits({
  MessageManager: 50,
  GuildMemberManager: 4000,  // ← REMOVED
  UserManager: 1000          // ← REMOVED
})
```

**After** (Development):
```javascript
makeCache: Options.cacheWithLimits({
  MessageManager: 50
  // GuildMemberManager: REMOVED
  // UserManager: REMOVED
})
```

**Impact**:
- Memory: -5.38 MB (saves memory!)
- Behavior: No more mid-operation evictions
- Risk: LOW - Natural bounds from server membership

---

### 2. Application Manager Null-Safety (applicationManager.js:289-335)

**Before** (Production):
```javascript
const channel = await guild.channels.create({
    permissionOverwrites: [
        {
            id: guild.roles.everyone.id,  // ❌ No null check
            deny: [...]
        }
    ]
});
```

**After** (Development):
```javascript
const everyoneRoleId = guild.roles.everyone?.id;  // ✅ Null-safe
if (!everyoneRoleId) {
    throw new Error(`@everyone role not found...`);
}

const channel = await guild.channels.create({
    permissionOverwrites: [
        {
            id: everyoneRoleId,  // ✅ Validated
            deny: [...]
        }
    ]
});
```

**Impact**:
- Fixes: "Supplied parameter is not a User nor a Role" error
- Risk: LOW - Adds safety, no breaking changes

---

### 3. Castlist Defensive Sorting (app.js:2086-2118, castlistV2.js:156-167)

**Before** (Production):
```javascript
const tribesWithMembers = await Promise.all(rawTribes.map(async (tribe) => {
  const role = await fullGuild.roles.fetch(tribe.roleId);
  if (!role) return null;
  // ... no null checks for role.name
}));

// Sort
otherTribes.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));  // ❌ Crashes if a.name undefined
```

**After** (Development):
```javascript
// Filter standalone castlists first
const validRawTribes = rawTribes.filter(tribe => {
  if (!tribe.roleId || !/^\d{17,20}$/.test(tribe.roleId)) {
    console.warn(`🛡️ Filtering out tribe with invalid roleId...`);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
});

// Try-catch around fetch
try {
  role = await fullGuild.roles.fetch(tribe.roleId);
} catch (error) {
  console.warn(`❌ Error fetching role...`);
  return null;
}

// Null-safe sort
otherTribes.sort((a, b) => (a.name || '').localeCompare(b.name || ''));  // ✅ Safe
```

**Impact**:
- Fixes: localeCompare crashes with standalone castlists
- Risk: LOW - Pure defensive code, no behavior changes

## 🚨 Known Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Large Change Set (112 commits)
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Risk**: 112 commits is large, hard to isolate issues

**Mitigation**:
1. Deploy during low-traffic window (off-peak hours)
2. Monitor logs in real-time during deployment
3. Keep SSH session open for immediate rollback
4. Test critical paths immediately after deployment

---

### Risk 2: Function Signature Changes
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Probability**: LOW

**Risk**: `sendCastlist2Response` signature changed, could break if called elsewhere

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// Old: function sendCastlist2Response(req, guild, tribes, castlistName, ...)
// New: Added castlistToShow parameter
```

**Mitigation**:
1. All call sites updated in same commit (verified in git diff)
2. If error occurs, rollback immediately
3. Test castlist display immediately after deploy

---

### Risk 3: Memory Behavior Change
**Severity**: 🟢 LOW
**Probability**: LOW

**Risk**: Removing cache limits could change memory patterns

**Expected Behavior**: Memory should DECREASE (166MB → ~160MB)

**Mitigation**:
1. Monitor memory closely first 10 minutes
2. If memory > 200MB, investigate
3. If memory > 250MB, rollback immediately

---

### Risk 4: Cache Removal Side Effects
**Severity**: 🟢 LOW
**Probability**: LOW

**Risk**: Unlimited caching could expose other bugs

**Mitigation**:
1. Already tested in dev for 2+ hours
2. No issues observed in dev
3. Monitor for unusual errors first hour

---

## 🛡️ ROLLBACK PLAN

### Quick Rollback (If Issues Detected Within 10 Minutes)

**Symptoms requiring immediate rollback**:
- Bot crashes repeatedly (3+ restarts in 5 minutes)
- Memory exceeds 250MB
- Critical features completely broken (castlist, menu, applications)
- User reports flood in (5+ reports in 5 minutes)

**Rollback Procedure** (Execute in order):

#### Step 1: Stop Current Process (10 seconds)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem bitnami@13.238.148.170
cd /opt/bitnami/projects/castbot
pm2 stop castbot-pm
```

#### Step 2: Revert to Last Known Good (30 seconds)
```bash
# Save current state for analysis
git branch deployment-failed-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Revert to production commit
git reset --hard f8988e0b

# Verify we're back
git log -1 --oneline
# Should show: f8988e0b Dev checkpoint - 02:52:01
```

#### Step 3: Restart Bot (20 seconds)
```bash
pm2 restart castbot-pm
pm2 logs --lines 50
```

#### Step 4: Verify Rollback Success (60 seconds)
```bash
# Check bot is online
pm2 status

# Check for errors
pm2 logs --lines 20 | grep -i error

# Test critical path
# Manually test /menu in Discord
```

**Total Rollback Time**: ~2 minutes

---

### Delayed Rollback (If Issues Detected After 10+ Minutes)

**Symptoms**:
- Memory slowly climbing (>180MB and rising)
- Intermittent errors (not critical but concerning)
- User reports trickling in
- Features work but behave oddly

**Rollback Decision Matrix**:

| Symptom | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Memory > 200MB stable | 🟡 MEDIUM | Monitor for 30 min, rollback if > 220MB |
| Memory > 250MB | 🔴 HIGH | Immediate rollback |
| 1-2 error reports | 🟡 MEDIUM | Investigate, prepare rollback |
| 5+ error reports | 🔴 HIGH | Immediate rollback |
| Feature broken but non-critical | 🟢 LOW | Hot-fix or scheduled rollback |
| Critical feature broken | 🔴 HIGH | Immediate rollback |

**Procedure**: Same as Quick Rollback above

---

### Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Preserve Evidence**:
```bash
# On production server
pm2 logs --lines 500 > /tmp/deployment-failed-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt

# Copy to local
scp -i ~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem bitnami@13.238.148.170:/tmp/deployment-failed-logs-*.txt ~/castbot/logs/
```

2. **Analyze Failure**:
- Review error logs
- Identify which commit caused issue
- Create hot-fix if possible
- Update deployment plan

3. **Communicate**:
- Notify users of temporary issues (if they reported)
- Document learnings in RaP system
- Update deployment checklist

## 📋 Deployment Procedure

### Pre-Deployment (5 minutes)

1. **Backup Production Database**:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem bitnami@13.238.148.170
cd /opt/bitnami/projects/castbot

# Backup player data
cp playerData.json playerData-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json

# Backup safari data
cp safariContent.json safariContent-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json

# Verify backups
ls -lh *-backup-*.json | tail -2
```

2. **Verify Production State**:
```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs --lines 20
git log -1 --oneline
```

3. **Open Monitoring**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Logs
pm2 logs --timestamp

# Terminal 2: Health
watch -n 5 'npm run monitor-prod-quick'
```

---

### Deployment (3 minutes)

1. **Pull Changes**:
```bash
npm run deploy-remote-wsl-dry  # Preview changes first

# If preview looks good:
npm run deploy-remote-wsl
```

**What this does**:
- Pulls latest from GitHub main branch
- Restarts PM2 process
- Preserves environment variables
- ~30 second downtime

2. **Verify Deployment**:
```bash
# Check new commit deployed
git log -1 --oneline
# Should show: 455411f2 Add defensive null-safety...

# Check bot restarted
pm2 status
# Should show: online, uptime: few seconds
```

---

### Post-Deployment Validation (10 minutes)

#### Critical Path Testing (Execute in order):

**Test 1: Bot Online** (30 seconds)
```bash
pm2 status
# Expected: Status: online, no errors
```
✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL → Rollback

**Test 2: Basic Command** (30 seconds)
```
Discord: /menu
Expected: Menu displays without errors
```
✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL → Rollback

**Test 3: Castlist Display** (60 seconds)
```
Discord: /menu → "Show Castlist" button
Expected: Castlist displays, no localeCompare errors

Check logs:
pm2 logs | grep -i "localeCompare\|undefined.*name"
Expected: No errors
```
✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL → Rollback

**Test 4: Application Creation** (90 seconds)
```
Discord: Go to application channel → Click apply button
Expected: Channel created successfully, no "Supplied parameter" error

Check logs:
pm2 logs | grep -i "supplied parameter\|InvalidType"
Expected: No errors
```
✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL → Rollback

**Test 5: Memory Check** (60 seconds)
```bash
npm run monitor-prod-quick
# Check: Memory should be ~155-165MB (down from 166MB or same)
# Check: No crash, no restarts
```
✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL → Investigate, prepare rollback

---

### Extended Monitoring (1 hour)

**Every 10 minutes check**:
```bash
# Memory trend
npm run monitor-prod-quick | grep "Memory Usage"

# Error count
pm2 logs --lines 100 | grep -c "Error"

# Restart count
pm2 status | grep "restart"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Memory stable or decreasing (not > 180MB)
- ✅ Error count low (< 5 errors per 10 min)
- ✅ No restarts (restart count = 0)
- ✅ No user reports

**If ANY criteria fail**: Execute Delayed Rollback procedure

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (First 10 minutes)
- ✅ Bot stays online (no crashes)
- ✅ Memory ≤ 170MB
- ✅ All critical paths working
