# Definition of Done (DoD)

This checklist MUST be completed for every feature, fix, or enhancement before it can be considered "done". Use this as your final quality gate.

## 🎯 Core Requirements

### 1. Functionality
- [ ] Feature works as specified in requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No regression in existing features

### 2. Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants/config)

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] All async operations wrapped in try-catch
- [ ] User-friendly error messages (not stack traces)
- [ ] Errors logged with context
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks for non-critical failures
- [ ] Network failures handled appropriately

### 4. Logging Requirements
Every feature MUST include comprehensive logging following our logging standards:

**📋 MANDATORY:** Follow [docs/architecture/LoggingStandards.md](docs/architecture/LoggingStandards.md) for all logging

#### Required Logging Points
- [ ] Use logger utility (not direct console.log):
  ```javascript
  import { logger } from './logger.js';
  logger.debug('FEATURE', 'Starting action', { userId, context });
  ```
- [ ] Debug logging for development troubleshooting
- [ ] Info logging for important user actions
- [ ] Error logging with proper context and error objects
- [ ] Performance logging for operations > 100ms:
  ```javascript
  const start = Date.now();
  // ... operation ...
  logger.perf('FEATURE', 'operation name', Date.now() - start);
  ```

#### Analytics Logging
- [ ] User interactions logged via `logInteraction()`:
  ```javascript
  await logInteraction(guildId, userId, interactionType, customId);
  ```

#### Environment Awareness
- [ ] Debug logs only run in development (unless FORCE_DEBUG=true)
- [ ] Info/warn/error logs always run
- [ ] Use consistent feature categories (SAFARI, MENU, BUTTON, etc.)

### 5. Discord Integration
- [ ] Respects Discord API limits:
  - 40 components per message
  - 5 fields per modal
  - 25 options per select menu
  - 100 character custom_id limit
  - 3 second interaction response time
- [ ] Uses appropriate interaction response types
- [ ] Ephemeral messages for errors/private info
- [ ] Mobile Discord UI tested

### 6. Security
- [ ] Permission checks implemented where needed
- [ ] No exposed secrets or tokens in code/logs
- [ ] User input validated and sanitized
- [ ] Admin features properly restricted
- [ ] No SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] JSDoc comments for new functions:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Brief description of function
   * @param {string} paramName - Description
   * @returns {Object} Description of return
   */
  ```
- [ ] Complex algorithms documented
- [ ] Integration points explained
- [ ] README/help text updated if needed

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Happy path tested manually
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Edge cases tested:
  - Empty data
  - Invalid input
  - Missing permissions
  - Network failures
- [ ] Cross-browser tested (if web UI)
- [ ] Mobile Discord tested

### 9. Performance
- [ ] Response time < 3 seconds
- [ ] No blocking operations on main thread
- [ ] Efficient data structures used
- [ ] Database queries optimized (if applicable)
- [ ] Memory leaks checked

### 10. Button/Component Handlers
If feature includes Discord buttons/components:
- [ ] Handler added to app.js in correct location
- [ ] Context variables extracted at start:
  ```javascript
  const guildId = req.body.guild_id;
  const userId = req.body.member?.user?.id || req.body.user?.id;
  ```
- [ ] Try-catch wrapper implemented
- [ ] BUTTON_HANDLER_REGISTRY.md updated
- [ ] Custom ID pattern documented
- [ ] Dynamic handler exclusions added if needed

### 11. Data Management
- [ ] Data structure documented
- [ ] Migration path for existing data
- [ ] Backup considerations addressed
- [ ] Data validation implemented
- [ ] Storage limits considered

### 12. Deployment
- [ ] Code committed with descriptive message
- [ ] No console.log for sensitive data
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Deployment instructions updated
- [ ] Rollback plan considered
