# CastBot Analytics & Logging System

## Overview

CastBot includes a comprehensive analytics and logging system that tracks user interactions, server usage, and provides insights into how the bot is being used across Discord servers.

## System Components

### 1. Analytics Logger (`analyticsLogger.js`)
The core module that handles all interaction logging with the following features:
- Tracks every user interaction (commands, buttons, selects, modals)
- Stores logs in structured format for analysis
- Supports live Discord posting for real-time monitoring
- Maintains user exclusion lists for filtering admin activity

### 2. Server Usage Analytics (`serverUsageAnalytics.js`)
Provides server-by-server usage analysis with:
- 7-day activity analysis
- Server ranking by interaction count
- User engagement metrics
- Command vs button usage ratios
- Rich Discord embed formatting for results

### 3. Live Discord Logging
Real-time posting of analytics events to a Discord channel (#logs):
- Channel ID: 1385059476243218552
- Markdown formatted messages
- Rate limited to prevent spam (1.2 second delay)
- Non-blocking error handling

## Implementation Details

### Log Format
```
[timestamp] guildName (guildId) | userName (userId) | interactionType | customId
```

Example:
```
[11:19AM] Fri 27 Dec 24 | CastBot Testing | reecepbcups (391415444084490240) | BUTTON | prod_menu
```

### Interaction Types Tracked
- `COMMAND` - Slash command executions
- `BUTTON` - Button clicks
- `SELECT` - Select menu interactions
- `MODAL` - Modal form submissions

### Data Storage
- Logs stored in `/logs/user-analytics.log`
- Rotating log files to manage disk space
- Text-based format for easy parsing and analysis

## Configuration

### Environment Configuration
Stored in `playerData.json` under `environmentConfig.liveDiscordLogging`:
```json
{
  "environmentConfig": {
    "liveDiscordLogging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channelId": "1385059476243218552",
      "excludedUsers": ["391415444084490240"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Command-Line Management
Use the `toggle-live-logging.js` script:
```bash
node toggle-live-logging.js on        # Enable live logging
node toggle-live-logging.js off       # Disable live logging
node toggle-live-logging.js exclude <discordId>  # Toggle user exclusion
```

## Usage

### Viewing Server Stats
1. Access via Production Menu â†’ Reece Stuff â†’ Server Usage Stats
2. Restricted to specific user IDs for security
3. Displays top 10 servers with detailed metrics

### Analytics Output Features
- **Top Server Rankings**: Medal emojis (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰) for top 3
- **Interaction Breakdown**: Commands vs buttons percentages
- **User Engagement**: Unique user counts per server
- **Smart Insights**: Identifies usage patterns

### Example Output
```
ðŸ¥‡ **Reality Lounge** (973372584331358308)
   ðŸ“Š Total: 1,234 | ðŸ‘¥ Users: 45
   âš¡ Commands: 523 (42%) | ðŸ”˜ Buttons: 711 (58%)
   ðŸ’¡ Button-heavy server with high engagement
```

## Integration Points

### Adding Analytics to New Features
```javascript
// Import the logger
const { logInteraction } = require('./analyticsLogger.js');

// Log interactions
await logInteraction(guildId, userId, 'BUTTON', 'my_new_button');
```

### Excluding Admin Actions
Admin user IDs can be excluded from logs to focus on real user activity:
- Use the exclude command to toggle users
- Excluded users' interactions won't appear in logs or Discord

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Logging**: All logging is asynchronous to prevent blocking
- **Error Isolation**: Logging errors don't affect main bot functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Discord posts are queued with 1.2s delays
- **File I/O**: Append-only operations for efficiency

## Security & Privacy

- No message content is logged
- Only interaction metadata is stored
- User IDs are included but can be excluded
- Guild-specific data stays within guild context

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Visual Analytics
- Chart generation for usage trends
- Time-based activity heatmaps
- User journey visualization
- Export capabilities for external analysis

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
- Predictive analytics for server growth
- Feature adoption tracking
- A/B testing framework
- Custom analytics dashboards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Logs not appearing**: Check if live logging is enabled
2. **Missing interactions**: Verify user isn't excluded
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure bot has file write permissions
4. **Discord rate limits**: Check for rate limit messages in console

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in analyticsLogger.js:
```javascript
const DEBUG = true; // Set to true for verbose logging
```

## Maintenance

### Log Rotation
- Logs should be rotated periodically to manage disk space
- Archive old logs before deletion for historical analysis
- Consider implementing automatic rotation based on file size

### Data Retention
- Current: Unlimited retention
- Recommended: 90-day rolling window
- Archive important metrics separately
