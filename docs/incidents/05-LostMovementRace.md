# Incident 05: Lost Movement Race — playerData.json Concurrent Load-Modify-Save Clobber

**Status**: 🟢 Tactical fix (Option A, `withStorageLock` on the four incident writers) **LIVE ON PROD 2026-07-15** (commit `95429121`, deployed on Reece's explicit permission). Validated on TEST under real concurrency first (two users moving in the same second — both writes survived, save sizes monotonically increasing). Residual: other playerData writers still unserialized (wrap as touched); end-state = RaP 0915 in-memory store.
**Date**: 2026-07-15
**Moved**: from `docs/01-RaP/0896_...` to incidents (Reece, 2026-07-15)
**Severity**: Production data loss (player state), silent, intermittent
**Related**: [0915 Memory Footprint / playerData cache](0915_20260628_MemoryLeak_Analysis.md) *(root-fix vehicle)*, the unresolved DNC/completion persistence bug (suspect list included `storage.js:11` global requestCache — this incident confirms the bug class)

## Original Context (Trigger Prompt)

> So a production admin user has reported a bug where a player has been initialised in G1, moved to F1, then moved to E2, but her movement to E2 hasn't been recognised officially by castbot, although i can see it in logs etc. The logs show some unusual disrepencies:

## 🤔 Plain English: What Actually Happened

gabi clicked **Move to E2** at almost the same moment another player (Meaghan) clicked **Search Alley** (a give-item custom action) in a different cell. Both handlers do the same dance on the *same file*: load all of `playerData.json` into memory, change their little corner of it, and write the **whole file** back.

Both loaded the same "before" snapshot. gabi's move wrote back a world where she's at E2. A moment later, Meaghan's item handler wrote back **its** world — built from the snapshot where gabi was still at F1. gabi's move was erased from disk as if it never happened.

Everything that *doesn't* live in `playerData.json` survived, which is exactly why the symptoms looked so schizophrenic:

| Evidence | Where it lives | Survived? |
|---|---|---|
| Stamina deducted (2→1) | `safariContent.json` (different file) | ✅ |
| Movement log entry "Moved from F1 to E2" | Safari Log / activity history (written later by batched flush) | ✅ |
| Channel permissions (E2 granted, F1 removed) | Discord itself | ✅ |
| "has arrived at E2" message | Discord itself | ✅ |
| `currentLocation = E2` | `playerData.json` | ❌ **clobbered** |
| `E2` in `exploredCoordinates` | `playerData.json` | ❌ **clobbered** (map shows 2/49) |

So gabi was *physically* in the E2 channel (permissions say so) while the bot's record said F1 — hence clicking Navigate in E2 produced "❌ You are no longer at E2. Your current location is F1" (the stale-channel guard at `app.js:4685` doing its job against corrupted state).

**The smoking gun in her activity log:** for the very same clicks, `⚡ Action (E2)` entries sit next to `🧰 Item (F1)` / `🪙 Currency (F1)` entries. Action entries take their location from the *channel* the button was clicked in (E2); item/currency entries read the player's *stored* location (already reverted to F1). Two sources of truth disagreeing in the same second = lost write.

## 📊 Prod Log Evidence (pm2, castbot-pm-out.log ~line 88600-88810)

The file-size fingerprints make it irrefutable:

```
✅ Loaded playerData.json (4241423 bytes)   ← gabi's safari_move_E2 loads (pre-move state)
🗑️ Clearing request cache ...              ← Meaghan's search_alley interaction arrives mid-move
✅ Loaded playerData.json (4241423 bytes)   ← Meaghan's give_item loads the SAME pre-move state
✅ Saved playerData (4241602 bytes)         ← gabi's setPlayerLocation saves (F1→E2 written) ✔
✅ Saved playerData (4241536 bytes)         ← Meaghan's item save lands AFTER, from pre-move copy ✘
✅ Loaded playerData.json (4241536 bytes)   ← E2 move is gone from disk
...
✅ SUCCESS: safari_move_E2 - player moved successfully   ← move flow never knew
```

`4241602 > 4241536`: the second save is *smaller* because it contains Meaghan's new item but **not** gabi's movement-history entry, explored coordinate, or new location.

    participant F as playerData.json

    G->>F: loadPlayerData() → copy A (gabi @ F1)
    M->>F: loadPlayerData() → copy B (gabi @ F1)
    Note over G: usePoints() ✅ (safariContent.json — survives)
    G->>F: save copy A (gabi @ E2) — 4,241,602 bytes 🟢
    M->>F: save copy B (+item, gabi @ F1) — 4,241,536 bytes 🔴
    Note over F: LAST WRITE WINS<br/>gabi's move erased
    Note over G: grants E2 perms, removes F1 perms,<br/>posts arrival, logs movement —<br/>all against a location that no longer exists on disk
```

## 🏛️ Why the Architecture Allows This

- `atomicSave` has a **write mutex** — it prevents interleaved/corrupt *writes*, and it worked perfectly here. Both writes were clean. It cannot prevent a **stale read-modify-write**: the atomicity boundary needed is *load→mutate→save*, not just *save*.
- `withStorageLock(fn)` (`storage.js:20`) exists for **exactly this** — it serializes whole load-modify-save cycles — but almost nothing uses it. `setPlayerLocation` (`mapMovement.js:42`), the give_item/currency mutation paths in `safariManager.js`, and most other playerData writers each do their own unserialized `loadPlayerData → mutate → savePlayerData`.
- The `requestCache` (`storage.js:11`) is **global, not per-request**, cleared at the start of each interaction and after each save — so overlapping deferred handlers routinely hold *different* snapshots of the same file (as here), or occasionally the *same mutable object*. Either mode can lose writes.
- The activity-log batcher (`activityLogger.js`) already had to work around this ("flushed in a single load-modify-save cycle to avoid racing with other saves") — the workaround protects *its own* entries but any whole-file save can still clobber concurrent field-level changes.

**Odds**: any two playerData-mutating interactions whose load→save windows overlap can eat each other. Deferred safari handlers hold the window open for seconds (Discord REST calls happen mid-cycle in some paths). On a busy safari night with players spam-clicking custom actions, this is not rare — it's a background error rate. This is very likely the same mechanism as the unresolved DNC/completion persistence bug (same suspect was already on file).

## 💡 Fix Options

| Option | What | Risk | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Serialize cycles with `withStorageLock`** | Wrap every playerData load-modify-save (setPlayerLocation, give_item, currency, claims, etc.) in the existing lock | Low-medium: must find all ~write sites; adds latency serialization but writes are already mutex-serialized at the tail | 🟢 Tactical fix, incremental |
| **B. Single in-memory playerData store** | One canonical in-mem object; handlers mutate it directly; debounced flusher persists (the RaP 0915 root fix — also solves the OOM re-parse cost) | Higher: architectural, needs care around restarts/backups | 🟢 Strategic fix — A converges into B |
| **C. Field-level patch writes** | Writers submit path-scoped patches applied against fresh state under the lock | Medium: new API, migration | 🟡 Variant of A with nicer semantics |
| **D. Do nothing, admin re-moves players** | Status quo | Silent state loss keeps happening; hosts lose trust | 🔴 |

**Recommendation**: A now (start with the highest-traffic writers: movement, give_item, currency), B as the destination per RaP 0915. **Not deployed to prod without explicit permission — active games running.**

### Option A — IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15 (dev + test)

The four incident-class writers now run their load→mutate→save cycles under `withStorageLock`:

| Writer | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `setPlayerLocation` | `mapMovement.js` | whole body wrapped (the write that was erased) |
| `updateCurrency` | `safariManager.js` | lock covers load→save only; Safari Log posting stays outside |
| `addItemToInventory` | `safariManager.js` | locked only when it owns the cycle (skips lock when caller passes `existingPlayerData` — caller owns the cycle); the writer that did the erasing |
| `removeItemFromInventory` | `safariManager.js` | same pattern (the `take` half of give_item) |

Guardrails so the lock stays safe as the codebase grows:
- **`withStorageLock` JSDoc** (storage.js) — full when/when-not decision guide: load inside the lock, nothing slow (no Discord calls/image renders) inside, not re-entrant (never call another lock-taker from inside).
- **CLAUDE.md** — new "🔴 CRITICAL: playerData Writes — Use the Storage Lock" section with the wrap pattern.
- **`tests/storageLock.test.js`** — reproduces the unlocked lost-update, proves both writes survive under the lock, proves an error inside the lock can't jam the queue.

**Known remaining gap (why status is 🟡 not 🟢):** the lock only protects lock-users from each other. Other playerData writers (stores, claims, admin edits, etc.) are still unserialized and can clobber/be clobbered. Migrate writers incrementally as touched; the real end-state is the RaP 0915 in-memory store.

## ⚠️ The Stamina 999 Fear — Cleared

At incident time the guild config was `starting=3, max=999, regen=720min, regenAmount=1` (drip +1/12h). Admin has since set `max=3`. Verified directly against prod `safariContent.json` (read-only):

- `safariConfig`: `{starting: 3, max: 3, regenMin: 720, regenAmt: 1}`
- **24 stamina records, 0 players with `current > 3`.**

Three reasons nobody gets near-unlimited movement: (1) `max` is *derived* — the stamina-only reconcile (`pointsManager.js:381`) snaps every player's stored max to the config value on their next read, which the activity screenshots already show (`2/3`); (2) only *max* was ever 999 — currents were 0–3 the whole time; (3) `regenAmount=1` drip adds one point per period only while `current < effectiveMax`, so it can never overshoot a max of 3.

## ✅ Shipped With This Analysis (dev + test only)

Movement-source log markers (the admin's ask):
- Player activity log + global Safari Log now render `🗺️ ADMIN Movement` / `ADMIN MOVEMENT` for Player-Admin moves and `TELEPORT Movement` / `TELEPORT MOVEMENT` for action-outcome teleports (which also pass `adminMove:true` internally — labeling off that flag alone would have mislabeled teleports as admin moves).
- When a Navigate click originates from a pane whose coordinate differs from the player's origin cell (the stale-pane case this incident produced), logs append `` `via X pane` ``.
- Plumbing: `movePlayer(options.moveSource/viaChannelId)` → `logPlayerMovement(moveSource/viaPane)` → activity entry `src`/`via` fields + `analyticsLogger` SAFARI_MOVEMENT header. Backfill parser phrasing preserved. Tests: `tests/activityLogger.test.js`.
