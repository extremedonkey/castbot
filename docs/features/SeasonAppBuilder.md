# Season Application Builder

This document serves as the source of truth for the Season Application Builder feature in CastBot. Any updates, clarifications, or additional information about this feature should be documented here.

## Overview

### Overall Objectives

**For Server Admins:**
- Create application buttons for prospective player recruitment

- Streamline player recruitment with automated application collection

**For Applicants/Players:**
- Simple application process via clicking application buttons
- Private application channels for submitting applications
- Clear indication of application status

### Current Implementation Status

The Season Application Builder is currently a **basic applicant recruitment system** accessible through Production Menu > Season Applications.

## Product Backlog

### Future Enhancement: Dynamic Question Builder System
**Description:** Advanced application form creation with custom questions and automated data collection
**Priority:** High (increased from Medium due to DNC and Accommodations features)
**Status:** Requirements documented, ready for implementation

## Dynamic Question Builder System - Detailed Requirements

### Overview & User Experience Flow

The Dynamic Question Builder System enables server admins to create sophisticated, multi-step application processes with custom questions, automated data collection, and intelligent user experience flows. The system leverages CastBot's existing Safari-style entity management interface for configuration and Discord Components V2 for modern user interactions.

- **Entity Selection**: String select with seasons (`entity_select_seasons`)
  - Existing seasons listed by name
  - "‚ûï New Season" option for creation
- **Entity Management**: Container-based `entity_field_group_*` interface
- **Configuration**: Modal-driven text inputs for question setup
- **Question Management**: Button-launched modals for each question type

**Season as Master Entity:**
- Seasons become master data entities throughout CastBot
- Future integration with automatic Season Castlists
- Persistent season data for cross-feature utilization
- Guild-specific season management with reusable configurations

## Real Application Analysis & System Improvements

### Current State Analysis (Based on Sample Application)

**Sample Application Overview:**
- **Applicant**: Kayla (kay8978)
- **Season**: EpochORG S9: Land Before Time  
- **Duration**: 3-day process (June 11-14, 2025)
- **Bots Used**: 3 different Discord bots (disconnected workflow)

**Current Pain Points Identified:**

#### 1. **Fragmented Bot Ecosystem**
- **Current**: Application uses 3 separate bots with no integration
- **Issues**: 
  - Inconsistent user experience
  - Manual data transfer between systems
  - Higher chance of errors and lost information
- **CastBot Solution**: Single integrated system with all functionality

#### 2. **Clunky Command-Based Interface**
- **Current**: Carl-bot with `!q2`, `!q3`, `!q4` sequential commands
- **Issues**:
  - Users must remember exact command syntax
  - No progress tracking or validation
  - Prone to user error and confusion
- **CastBot Solution**: Modal-based sequential presentation with auto-progression

#### 3. **Manual Profile Collection**
- **Current**: Separate `/menu` command required before application
- **Issues**:
  - Additional step users often forget
  - Pronouns missed initially (had to be corrected later)
  - No integration with application flow
- **CastBot Solution**: Integrated profile questions with auto-progression and pre-population

#### 4. **Limited Question Types**
- **Current**: Only basic text questions supported
- **Issues**:
  - No structured data collection
  - No DNC list functionality
  - Basic accommodations question with no follow-up
  - No validation or data processing
- **CastBot Solution**: 4 specialized question types with structured data collection

#### 5. **Manual Casting Process**
- **Current**: Manual messages sent by production team members
- **Issues**:
  - Inconsistent messaging
  - No bulk operations
  - No status tracking
  - Additional manual requests for cast card info
- **CastBot Solution**: Automated bulk casting operations with template messaging

### Template Questions Based on Sample

**Suggested Question Templates for Season Setup:**

```json
{
  "commonQuestions": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Tell us a little about yourself! What are your hobbies, interests, pet peeves, etc?",
      "placeholder": "Share as much as you'd like so we can get to know you!",
      "charLimit": 2000,
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "text", 
      "question": "Do you watch Survivor? If yes, what are some of your favorite seasons and players?",
      "placeholder": "Share your favorites and why you like them",
      "charLimit": 1500,
      "required": false
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Which archetype fits you best: challenge beast, social butterfly, or strategic mastermind? Why?",

### Competitive Advantages Over Current System

1. **Single Bot Integration**: No more juggling 3 different bots
2. **Modern UI**: Discord Components V2 vs. command-line interface
3. **Data Integrity**: Structured collection vs. free-form text parsing
4. **Automated Workflows**: Bulk operations vs. manual processes
5. **Advanced Features**: DNC detection, accommodation tracking, conflict alerts
6. **Consistent Experience**: Template-driven vs. ad-hoc messaging
7. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time state management vs. no progress indication
8. **Error Prevention**: Validation and confirmation vs. manual error checking

This analysis demonstrates how the Dynamic Question Builder System directly addresses real pain points experienced by ORG communities while providing significant improvements in user experience, data quality, and administrative efficiency.

## Technical Implementation

### Current Architecture
- **Access**: Production Menu ‚Üí Season Applications submenu
- **Permissions**: Admin-only features (Manage Roles/Channels/Server)
- **Storage**: playerData.json with applications and rankings sections

### Current Limitations

- No structured application forms
- Limited to basic channel-based application process
- No advanced applicant filtering or search
- No response data collection beyond basic applicant info

### Future Technical Considerations
- **Safari Integration**: Could leverage Safari's dynamic content framework

- **Data Scaling**: Current JSON-based storage suitable for small-medium servers
- **Performance**: Real-time ranking updates work well for current implementation
