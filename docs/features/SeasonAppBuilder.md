# Season Application Builder

This document serves as the source of truth for the Season Application Builder feature in CastBot. Any updates, clarifications, or additional information about this feature should be documented here.

## Overview

### Overall Objectives

**For Server Admins:**
- Create dynamic, customizable application forms for each season/game without coding knowledge
- Streamline the player recruitment process with automated application collection
- Efficiently review, sort, and rank applicants through a unified dashboard
- Export application data for external analysis and decision-making
- Reduce manual work in managing prospective players

**For Applicants/Players:**
- Simple, intuitive application process directly within Discord
- Clear question presentation with various response types
- Progress tracking through multi-step applications
- Immediate submission confirmation
- Transparent application status updates

### Overall Solution Architecture

The Season Application Builder is designed as an extension of the Safari dynamic content management system, leveraging existing infrastructure while adding application-specific functionality.

**Key Architectural Components:**
1. **Safari Framework Integration**: Built on top of `safariManager.js` for button creation and dynamic content
2. **Entity Management**: Extends `entityManager.js` to support application entities with CRUD operations
3. **Edit Framework**: Utilizes `editFramework.js` for the universal editing interface
4. **Data Storage**: Applications stored in `safariContent.json`, responses in player-specific sections
5. **Modal-Based UI**: Sequential modal presentation for questions (Discord's 5-field limit per modal)
6. **Stateless Design**: Application progress tracked through custom_ids and temporary storage

**Technical Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Application data separate from core player data
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent applications per server
- **Reusability**: Shared components with other Safari features
- **Privacy**: Secure storage of applicant responses with admin-only access
- **Performance**: Efficient data retrieval and sorting for large applicant pools

### Alignment to Existing CastBot Features

**Integration Points:**
1. **Safari System**: Shares infrastructure with dynamic button creation and management
2. **Player Management**: Seamlessly transitions accepted applicants to player roster
3. **Cast Ranking**: Extends ranking functionality to applicant evaluation
4. **Role Management**: Automatic role assignment for accepted/rejected applicants
5. **Analytics**: Tracks application metrics through existing analytics system
6. **Production Menu**: Accessible through Safari submenu in production interface

**Consistent User Experience:**
- Follows established UI patterns from Safari buttons and player management
- Uses familiar Components V2 interface elements
- Maintains CastBot's admin permission model
- Integrates with existing help and documentation systems
