# Safari Map System - User & Admin Guide

## Overview

The Safari Map System transforms Discord into an interactive grid-based exploration system where players physically move between Discord channels representing map coordinates. Admins upload custom images, define grid dimensions, and create immersive exploration experiences.

## Current Capabilities (January 2025)

### Map Features
- **Custom Images**: Upload any Discord CDN image URL as your map
- **Flexible Grid Sizes**: Support for 1x1 to 100x100 grids (max 400 total cells)
- **Non-Square Maps**: Full support for rectangular grids (e.g., 3x1, 5x10, 20x5)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Replace map images without losing player progress or data
- **Fog of War**: Players only see their current location, other areas remain hidden

### Movement System
- **8-Directional Movement**: Move in cardinal and diagonal directions
- **Stamina-Based**: Each move costs 1 stamina point (default)
- **Stamina Regeneration**: Full reset every 12 hours (configurable)
- **Permission Management**: Automatic Discord channel access control
- **Navigate Button Pattern**: Clean ephemeral UI for movement selection

### Content Features
- **Location Stores**: Attach Safari stores to specific coordinates

## Player Experience

## Admin Guide

### Creating a Map

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
1. Upload your map image to any Discord channel
2. Right-click the image ‚Üí "Copy Link"

#### Step 3: Map Generation Process
The system will:

3. Create Discord channels (#a1, #b2, etc.)
4. Generate fog of war versions for each location

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "This interaction failed" on Movement
- **Cause**: Stale navigation button (player already moved)
- **Solution**: Use new Navigate button in current channel

#### Player Stuck/Can't Move
- **Check**: Stamina level (may be 0)
- **Check**: Valid moves available (not at edge)
- **Solution**: Admin move or wait for regeneration

#### Map Creation Stalls
- **Cause**: Discord rate limiting
- **Normal**: 5 channels per 5 seconds
- **Large maps**: Can take 10+ minutes

#### Fog Maps Not Showing
- **Check**: Image file exists in `/img/{guildId}/`
- **Solution**: Regenerate with Update Map

### Permission Issues

#### Player Can't See Channel
- **Verify**: Player is at that coordinate
- **Check**: Channel permissions
- **Fix**: Admin move player away and back

#### Multiple Channels Visible
- **Cause**: Permission cleanup failed
- **Fix**: Manual permission reset
- **Prevention**: Ensure proper movement flow

## Best Practices

### Map Design
- **Start Small**: Test with 3x3 or 5x5 maps
- **Clear Paths**: Ensure players can reach all areas
- **Strategic Blacklists**: Create maze-like experiences
- **Balanced Content**: Distribute rewards evenly

### Content Distribution
- **Early Rewards**: Place easy items near start
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Harder content further out
- **Hidden Secrets**: Reward thorough exploration
- **Store Placement**: Strategic locations for supplies

### Player Experience
- **Clear Descriptions**: Rich location narratives
- **Consistent Theme**: Unified adventure feel
- **Balanced Stamina**: Not too restrictive
- **Regular Events**: Time-limited content

## Examples

### Linear Adventure (1x5)
```
A1 (Start) ‚Üí A2 (Challenge) ‚Üí A3 (Store) ‚Üí A4 (Boss) ‚Üí A5 (Reward)
```

### Small Exploration (3x3)
```
A1 -- B1 -- C1
|     |     |
A2 -- B2 -- C2
|     |     |
A3 -- B3 -- C3
```
- B2: Central hub with main store
- Corners: Hidden rewards
- Edges: Exploration challenges

### Maze Map (5x5 with Blacklists)
- Blacklist strategic coordinates
