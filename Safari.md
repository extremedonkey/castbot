## Overview

**üíÄ TERMINOLOGY NOTE:** Due to American English localization requirements, anywhere this documentation says "Shop" it should be read as "Store" for user-facing interfaces. Technical database keys remain as "shops" for compatibility.

The Safari system is CastBot's dynamic content management framework that enables Discord server administrators to create interactive, button-driven experiences for their players. This system powers two major features:

### ü¶Å Safari Builder
Interactive adventures where players navigate through host-created content, make choices, earn/spend currency, and engage with dynamic storylines. Think of it as a "choose your own adventure" system built entirely within Discord.

### üìù Season Application Builder
Dynamic application processes where hosts define custom questions and collect structured responses from prospective players, replacing static forms with interactive Discord-native experiences.

## Core Features

### Shared Foundation
Both features leverage the same technical infrastructure:
- **Dynamic Component Creation**: Hosts can create custom Discord Components V2 interfaces
- **Content Management**: Store and retrieve host-defined content, questions, and player responses
- **State Tracking**: Monitor player progress, choices, and interactions
- **Currency System**: Track and manage virtual currencies (Safari-specific)
- **Modular Actions**: Chainable actions that can display content, modify state, or trigger follow-ups

### Design Principles
1. **Reusability**: Core functionality supports multiple use cases
2. **Lean MVP**: Start simple, architect for growth
3. **CastBot Alignment**: Uses existing UI patterns (Container components, production menu structure)
4. **Data Safety**: New features don't compromise existing playerData.json

## Architecture

### File Structure
```
/castbot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ safariManager.js        # Core safari functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ safariContent.json      # Button/content definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Safari.md              # This documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js                 # Button handler integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playerData.json        # Extended with safari fields
```

### Module Responsibilities

#### safariManager.js
- Button creation and management
- Action execution engine
- Currency operations
- Content retrieval and storage
- State management

#### Data Storage Strategy
- **safariContent.json**: All host-created content (buttons, actions, text)
- **playerData.json**: Only player-specific data (currency, history)
- Separation prevents corruption of critical player data

### Security Model
- Admin-only content creation (ManageRoles permission)
- Player interactions logged via analyticsLogger
- Rate limiting on currency actions
- Audit trail for all safari modifications

```
[Container: Accent Color #3498db]
  [Text Display]
    # Welcome to the Jungle Safari!
    You stand at the entrance to a dense jungle...
  [Separator]
  [Text Display]

```

#### Currency Update
```
[Ephemeral Message]
  ‚úÖ You found a treasure chest!
  +500 coins (Total: 1,500)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Custom ID Pattern
```
safari_{guildId}_{buttonId}_{timestamp}
Example: safari_123456789_start_adventure_1703001234567
```

### Core Functions

#### safariManager.js
```javascript
// Button Management
async function createCustomButton(guildId, buttonData, userId)
async function updateCustomButton(guildId, buttonId, updates)
async function deleteCustomButton(guildId, buttonId)
async function getCustomButton(guildId, buttonId)
async function listCustomButtons(guildId, filters)

// Action Execution
async function executeButtonActions(guildId, buttonId, userId, interaction)
async function executeDisplayText(config, interaction)
async function executeUpdateCurrency(config, userId, guildId, interaction)
async function executeFollowUpButton(config, interaction)

// Currency Management  
async function getCurrency(guildId, userId)
async function updateCurrency(guildId, userId, amount)
async function setCurrency(guildId, userId, amount)

// Safari Management
async function createSafari(guildId, safariData)
async function postButtonToChannel(guildId, buttonId, channelId, client)
```

### Button Handler Integration (app.js)
```javascript
} else if (custom_id.startsWith('safari_')) {
    const [, guildId, buttonId, timestamp] = custom_id.split('_');
    
    // Import and execute safari actions
    const { executeButtonActions } = await import('./safariManager.js');
    const result = await executeButtonActions(guildId, buttonId, userId, req.body);
    
    return res.send({
        type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
        data: result
    });
}
```

### Action Execution Pipeline
```javascript
async function executeButtonActions(guildId, buttonId, userId, interaction) {
    const button = await getCustomButton(guildId, buttonId);
    if (!button) throw new Error('Button not found');
    
    const results = [];
    
    // Sort actions by order
    const sortedActions = button.actions.sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order);
    
    for (const action of sortedActions) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'display_text':
                results.push(await executeDisplayText(action.config, interaction));
                break;
            case 'update_currency':
                results.push(await executeUpdateCurrency(action.config, userId, guildId, interaction));
                break;
            case 'follow_up_button':
                results.push(await executeFollowUpButton(action.config, interaction));
                break;
        }
    }
    
    // Combine results into single response
    return combineActionResults(results);
}
```

## Test Cases

### MVP1 Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Basic Button Creation
1. Admin opens Production Menu
2. Clicks Safari ‚Üí Create Custom Button
3. Fills in: "Start Adventure", üó∫Ô∏è, Primary
4. Adds display_text action
5. Saves button
6. Verify button appears in "View All Buttons"

#### Test 2: Currency Flow
1. Create button with +100 currency action
2. Post to test channel
3. Player clicks button
4. Verify currency increases
5. Check playerData.json updated correctly

#### Test 3: Action Chain
1. Create Button A with follow-up to Button B
2. Button B has display_text
3. Player clicks Button A
4. Verify Button B appears
5. Click Button B, verify text displays

#### Test 4: Error Handling

This documentation serves as the complete guide for implementing and extending CastBot's Safari system. Always refer to this document when working with Safari, Idol Hunt, Questions, or dynamic content features.

# ORIGINAL TEXT PROMPT
Only refer to the following instructions if trying to clarify a requirement. Otherwise, where there is ambiguity, always refer to the content above this line as the source of truth.

I would like you to help me design / architect a new capability for CastBot, that will help enable two upcoming features. Originally I was considering these two features separately, but upon reflection I realise they involve the usage of the same types of user interface, data storage and interactions between UI and backend. Please include in Claude.MD instructions to refer to a new Safari.md file any time a prompt mentions Safari, Idol Hunt, Questions, or anything below that seems relevant. Create Safari.md based off of my prompt below and keep it up to date with the requirement, solution options (to meet the requirements), solution architecture (chosen high level solution option), releases (MVP1, MVP2, MVP3, MVPN.. - self contained releases), detailed design (functional design / interactions of the UI, data per each release, starting with MVP1), test cases and deployment steps.

Firstly, I'll describe the two features to give you some context:
1. Safari Builder: As CastBot is used in discord-based virtual versions of Reality Games (Online Reality Games - ORGs) - and particularly using the rules and format of the TV show Survivor, there is an opportunity to extend functionality to help hosts create what is often known as "Safaris" or "Idol Hunts", which are typically done manually with spreadsheets, limited bot-scripting languages and basic discord functionality. I would like to provide ORG game hosts (otherwise referred to admins / production) the ability to create and manage safaris through CastBot, saving them effort and creating an interactive player experience. In order to achieve this, it requires the ability to allow the /hosts/ to use the CastBot interface to create buttons which they can use CastBot to execute specific actions such as display text prepared by the hosts, generate Components with buttons that can act as shops, navigate to different areas of a virtual map, etc. This would also involve creating a currency system which in its MVP form can just be tracking currency against a user's entry in playerData.json. I also envisage some standard functionality like player currency management, custom item creation, assigning items to players, being able to buy items from stores etc. A key (nonMVP?) feature I would love is the ability for the user to upload an image (user created map for the safari) that is stored in the bot, and the bot automatically divides the map into coordinates.
2. Season Application Builder: This feature will involve extending the current 'Season Application' feature to allow hosts to create and edit an 'application process', which has its own per-application rules / behaviors defined, explanatory text, and allows hosts to create / update / edit questions that applicants will be presented for that season. As per current, hosts can then use Castbot to post an Season Application button (perhaps extended to a component which looks nicer) to a specified channel, and then any user with access to that channel can click the button to open a new channel. Once they open the channel, the questions defined by the hosts will be presented to any user applying. The bot must be able to capture and store their responses on a per-question basis - most likely by parsing messages between different questions (messages) the bot posts, and the player must be able to use the bot to easily move between questions and update their answers as needed. The data for the player's responses will then be used for a variety of future features, such as extending the existing Cast Ranking functionality to be richer.

So.. what is the common link between these two very different sounding features? Well, in essence they're both allowing end users to dynamically create and manage **content** from within the bot - user-defined Discord Components v2 such as text display, buttons, thumbnails, gallery, possibly even specific roles. For the Season Application feature they can leverage this to build dynamic application processes driven out of discord channels, defining questions as text and saving per season. For Safari Builder, they can define guided journeys that players can go on, helping them make turn-based moves, make in-game purchases from host-defined stores, with host defined-currencies on a per-season basis.

What are some of our design principles?
* Highly re-usable, well-documented functionality that you in particular are able to easily understand and continue to build upon. There is a good chance I'll use this core functionality to build something new.
* Starting with a 'Lean MVP' but architecting it right, building toward more rich and complex functionality and technical architectures. I want to get something up and running in the next few hours!	
* Alignment to the existing CastBot UX patterns which is usage of a the Container component, with nested buttons, selects and other components V2 control. Please ensure you refer to ComponentsV2.md (include in Safari.md).
* Integration with the existing CastBot functionality, particularly the playerData.json player management approach. This is one area I'd rather not go too crazy with changing as I don't want to impact live users. If applicable we can maintain linkages between files using discord user ID as a common identifier, though I am concerned with possible user / player identification issues.

What do I want for MVP1? The core technical plumbing to allow a production user for their server's prod menu to:
* Create a sub-menu called "Safari" in prod menu (ensure to never include more than 5 buttons in an actionrow) to house the new functionality below.
* Create a custom button with a custom label and emoji (note a basic version has already been implemented with Season Applications > Create Application Process), and allows them to define N number of custom button actions for that button
* A custom button action "display text" feature, that allows the host to set a title and text associated with that button, displayed inside a Container component. When the button is clicked, it will display that component in the channel it was clicked.
* A custom button action "update currency" feature, that allows the host to enter a positive or negative value. When clicked, it will look up the user that clicked the button's currency (most likely just a single JSON field stored against the existing player ID in playerData.json), and update the user's currency value accordingly, never dropping to zero.
* A custom button action "follow-up button" which allows the host to select an existing custom button they've already defined. When the user clicks the "initial" custom button, a new message will be posted the in the channel with the "follow up" custom button.
* The host can then save the custom button and all of the associated actions. Then, inside the "Safari" menu, another "Post custom button" action allows them to select a custom button, and a channel. CastBot will post the custom button into the channel they select (note this functionality is already partially implemented in the Season Applications menu / Create Application button, feel free to re-use / redesign according to design principles.

Now can you please:
* Come up with an overarching technical design for this entire feature
* Where there are multiple viable solution options per a particular topic or area, present me the options and considerations
* Ask me any questions to clarify the requirements
* Defined a proposed MVP solution based on above.
