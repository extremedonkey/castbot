## Example Structure
```json
{
  "1297188286191767603": {
    "players": {
      "208197633846542336": {
        "age": "21",
        "emojiCode": "<:208197633846542336:1322728046964375572>"
      }
    },
    "tribes": {
      "tribe1": "1324815211009671170",
      "tribe1emoji": "ðŸ¦ž"
    },
    "timezones": {
      "EST": {
        "roleId": "1320094346288300124",
        "offset": -5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## File Structure Comments
The playerData.json file uses a top-level comment to indicate server IDs:
```json
{
  "/* Server ID */": null,
  "1297188286191767603": {
    // Server data...
  }
}
```
This helps identify Discord guild IDs at a glance while maintaining valid JSON.
