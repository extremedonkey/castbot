Castbot will then order alphabetically-then-numerically, so a player who won S1 will appear above a player who won S9.\n\n**🎟️ Tips**\n• If a player has won multiple seasons, they'll only appear once, ordered by the first alpha-numerically ordered vanity role of the season they won.",

If you haven't used Castbot for your Season Apps, you can quickly create this from `/menu` > Apps and then return. This lets you set placements per-season.\n• Under 'Tribes on Castlist' add the Season Role that your players are assigned to\n• Click the Placements button and then click 'Set Place', this will ensure they are displayed in order of placement.\n\n🎟️ Tips\n• Players without a placement will appear first in the castlist - this is since it assumes the season is ongoing. If there is some reason for not assigning a player a placement, you can give them a dummy low ranking (e.g. 99) to put them at the bottom of the castlist.",
