# Windows Environment Migration Todo

## Old PC Setup Issues Found in Scripts

### dev-restart.js Notification Path
- **Issue**: Hardcoded old PC path in line 39
- **Current**: `(cd /mnt/c/Users/extre/OneDrive/ORG/01\ Zeldavivor/Tagscript/Castbot/castbot && node scripts/notify-restart.js 2>&1 | head -20) &`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Changed to use current directory

### General Path Issues
- Scripts were using `/mnt/c/Users/extre/OneDrive/ORG/01\ Zeldavivor/Tagscript/Castbot/castbot`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now using `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` for dynamic path detection

### SSH Configuration 
- **File Location**: `~/.ssh/config`
- **Required Entry**:
```
# CastBot AWS Lightsail Instance
Host castbot-lightsail
    HostName 13.238.148.170
    User bitnami
    IdentityFile "~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem"
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

### SSH Key Setup
- **File**: `castbot-key.pem` 
- **Location**: `~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem`
- **Permissions**: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/castbot-key.pem`
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS SETUP

### VS Code Integration
- Old setup may have had specific VS Code tasks/settings for the mounted drive
- New setup should use native WSL integration
- **Status**: ⚠️ REVIEW NEEDED

## Notes
- Environment is now properly integrated with VS Code + WSL
- Scripts updated to use git-based path detection instead of hardcoded Windows paths
- ngrok detection issues have been resolved
