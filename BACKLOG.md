# CastBot Development Backlog

This is a living requirements backlog for CastBot features and improvements, ordered by priority.

## COMPLETED (Recently Finished)

### ‚úÖ Request-Scoped Caching Optimization
**Completed:** 2025-07-04
**Description:** Implemented request-scoped caching for playerData.json and safariContent.json file I/O operations
**Impact:** 
- 5-10x performance improvement for complex interactions
- 95% reduction in file I/O time (from ~15ms to ~3ms for multi-step operations)
- Zero risk implementation - cache cleared between requests
- Built-in cache hit/miss metrics for monitoring
**Documentation:** See `/docs/architecture/RequestScopedCaching.md`

## IMMEDIATE Priority


## HIGH Priority

### Safari Menu Cleanup - Handler Review
**Description:** Review and potentially remove obsolete Safari button handlers after menu reorganization
**Tasks:**
- Check if `safari_manage_safari_buttons` handler is still needed (superseded by Custom Actions)
- Review `safari_navigate` handlers and map movement dependencies for cleanup
- Verify if Manage Safari Buttons UI components are still in use elsewhere
- Check Navigate button dependencies in map system
**Context:** Safari menu was reorganized to remove obsolete buttons and improve UI consistency

### Enhanced Pronoun Role Origin Tracking System
**Description:** Add metadata tracking to distinguish between CastBot-created and pre-existing pronoun roles for smarter management and safer operations
**Current Structure:** `pronounRoleIDs` is a simple array of role ID strings
**Proposed Structure:** Array of objects with origin tracking:
```json
"pronounRoleIDs": [
  {
    "id": "1389543002346885282",
    "createdBy": "castbot",
    "standardName": "He/Him"
  },
  {
    "id": "1389543002346885283", 
    "createdBy": "existing",
    "standardName": "She/Her",
    "originalName": "she/her"
  }
]
```
**Benefits:**
- Smarter nuke command: Could delete only CastBot-created roles, preserve existing ones
- Better setup feedback: "Found 3 existing roles, created 2 new ones"
- Safer operations: Avoid accidentally deleting user's original roles
- Enhanced debugging: Know exactly what CastBot created vs found
**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add backward compatibility migration logic
- Update all functions that use `pronounRoleIDs` array
- Modify `executeSetup()` to mark roles during creation/detection
- Update `createPronounReactionMessage()` to handle new format
**Priority:** High - Enhances safety and provides better user experience
**Risk Level:** Medium - Requires careful migration and testing

### Remove Deprecated Safari Customize Terms Modal Handler
**Description:** Remove commented-out legacy safari_customize_terms_modal handler after confirming new Components V2 field group interface works properly
**Location:** app.js lines ~12867-13013 (legacy modal handler is commented out)
**Context:** The legacy single-modal approach has been replaced by a Components V2 interface with grouped field editing (safari_config_modal_*)
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Verify new field group modals work for Currency & Inventory, Events, and Rounds customization
- Test reset to defaults functionality works properly
- Confirm all existing Safari functionality continues working with new custom terms system
- Remove commented code block and update ButtonHandlerRegistry.md
**Priority:** High - cleanup after successful Components V2 interface upgrade

### Remove Commented Safari Interface Code
**Description:** Remove commented out redundant Safari interface code that has been replaced by streamlined entity management system
**Location:** app.js lines ~5985-6064 (safari_item_create handler) and lines ~6153-6255 (safari_item_list handler)
**Context:** These handlers were commented out when safari_manage_items was streamlined to go directly to the entity management UI
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Remove all commented out code blocks marked with "COMMENTED OUT - REDUNDANT INTERFACE"
- Verify entity management system (safari_item_manage_existing) continues working properly  
- Test that safari_manage_items button goes directly to entity management without issues
- Ensure no references to commented handlers remain in the codebase
**Priority:** High - cleanup after successful interface streamlining implementation

### App.js Massive Code Reduction Initiative - Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
**Description:** Extract helper functions, consolidate permission checks, and move analytics handlers to reduce app.js by ~2,000 lines with minimal risk
**Current Size:** 14,000 lines - Target: Reduce by 70-85% through systematic refactoring
**Priority:** High (Low-hanging fruit with immediate benefits)

**üçÉ Phase 1A: Helper Function Extraction (800 lines saved, ZERO risk)**
**Risk Level:** None - These are self-contained utility functions with clear boundaries
**Implementation Time:** 1-2 days
**Files to Create:**
- `utils/castlistUtils.js` - Castlist calculation and field generation utilities
- `utils/emojiUtils.js` - Emoji creation, parsing, and cleanup utilities
- `utils/generalUtils.js` - Miscellaneous utility functions

**Specific Functions to Extract (app.js lines ~13,500-14,000):**
```javascript
// Castlist utilities (move to castlistUtils.js):
function calculateCastlistFields(guildTribes, defaultCastlist) // ~50 lines
function createMemberFields(members, tribeData, guildId) // ~80 lines  
function determineCastlistToShow(interaction, guildTribes) // ~40 lines
function createCastlistRows(tribeMembers, tribeData) // ~60 lines

// Emoji utilities (move to emojiUtils.js):
async function createEmojiForUser(client, guildId, member) // ~120 lines
function parseEmojiCode(emojiString) // ~30 lines
async function clearRoleEmojis(client, guildId, roleId) // ~80 lines

// General utilities (move to generalUtils.js):
function extractUsernameFromMention(userMention) // ~20 lines
function formatTimeDisplay(timezoneName, offset) // ~40 lines
function validateGuildPermissions(member, requiredPermission) // ~30 lines
```

**Post-Extraction app.js Updates:**
- Add imports: `import { createEmojiForUser, parseEmojiCode } from './utils/emojiUtils.js';`
- Update function calls throughout app.js to use imported functions
- Remove original function definitions from bottom of app.js
- **No logic changes** - pure code relocation with imports

**üîê Phase 1B: Permission Check Consolidation (500-700 lines saved, ZERO risk)**
**Risk Level:** None - Replacing identical code blocks with function calls
**Implementation Time:** 1 day

**Current Duplication Pattern (appears 50+ times):**
```javascript
// This EXACT pattern appears throughout app.js:
if (!member?.permissions || !(BigInt(member.permissions) & PermissionFlagsBits.ManageRoles)) {
    return res.send({
        type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
        data: {
            content: '‚ùå You need Manage Roles permission to use this feature.',
            flags: InteractionResponseFlags.EPHEMERAL
        }
    });
}
```

**Consolidated Implementation:**
```javascript
// Create in buttonHandlerUtils.js:
function requirePermission(req, res, permission, customMessage) {
    const member = req.body.member;
    if (!member?.permissions || !(BigInt(member.permissions) & permission)) {
        res.send({
            type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
            data: {
                content: customMessage || '‚ùå You need additional permissions to use this feature.',
                flags: InteractionResponseFlags.EPHEMERAL
            }
        });
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Replace all permission checks with:
if (!requirePermission(req, res, PermissionFlagsBits.ManageRoles)) return;
```

**üìä Phase 1C: Analytics Handler Extraction (400-500 lines saved, LOW risk)**
**Risk Level:** Low - Self-contained handlers with clear boundaries
**Implementation Time:** 1 day
**Target Location:** app.js lines ~4,900-5,300

**Handlers to Extract to `analyticsHandlers.js`:**
```javascript
// Move these complete handlers:
} else if (custom_id === 'prod_server_usage_stats') {
    // ~150 lines - Complete handler for server usage analytics
} else if (custom_id === 'prod_analytics_dump') {
    // ~200 lines - Complete handler for analytics dump
} else if (custom_id === 'toggle_live_logging') {
    // ~100 lines - Complete handler for live logging toggle
}
```

**Integration Pattern:**
```javascript
// In app.js, replace handlers with:
import { handleServerUsageStats, handleAnalyticsDump, handleLiveLogging } from './analyticsHandlers.js';

} else if (custom_id === 'prod_server_usage_stats') {
    return handleServerUsageStats(req, res, client);
} else if (custom_id === 'prod_analytics_dump') {
    return handleAnalyticsDump(req, res, client);
} else if (custom_id === 'toggle_live_logging') {
    return handleLiveLogging(req, res, client);
}
```

**Phase 1 Total Impact:**
- **Lines Reduced:** ~2,000 lines (14% reduction)
- **Risk Level:** Minimal (mostly code relocation)
- **Implementation Time:** 3-4 days
- **Files Created:** 4 new utility/handler modules
- **Maintainability:** Significantly improved through modularization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All extracted functions work identically to original implementations
- All imports properly configured and tested
- No functionality changes or regressions
- App.js reduced from 14,000 to ~12,000 lines
- Helper functions properly organized in logical modules
- Permission checks consolidated to single reusable function
- Analytics handlers cleanly separated into dedicated module

### App.js Massive Code Reduction Initiative - Phase 2 (Button Handler Reform)
**Description:** Consolidate massive button handler duplication using factory patterns and response builders
**Target:** Reduce app.js by additional 3,000-4,000 lines through handler abstraction
**Risk Level:** Medium (requires careful testing of handler behavior)
**Implementation Time:** 1 week after Phase 1 completion

**üîÑ Review BUTTON_HANDLER_*.md Documentation**
Before implementing button handler reform, review the documentation files in `docs/` for current implementation guidelines:
- `docs/BUTTON_HANDLER_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete menu hierarchy and implementation standards
- `docs/ButtonHandlerRegistry.md` - Current button handler registry
- `docs/BUTTON_INTERACTION_ANALYSIS.md` - Interaction analysis and patterns
Consider updating any outdated prompts or implementation guidelines based on current architecture.

**üîÑ Phase 2A: Button Handler Factory System (2,500-3,000 lines saved)**
**Current Issue:** Button handlers (lines ~2,800-11,000) contain massive duplication
**Solution:** Expand `buttonHandlerUtils.js` into comprehensive handler factory

**Common Handler Pattern (repeated 100+ times):**
```javascript
} else if (custom_id === 'example_button') {
    try {
        // Context extraction (identical in all handlers)
        const guildId = req.body.guild_id;
        const userId = req.body.member?.user?.id || req.body.user?.id;
        const member = req.body.member;
        const channelId = req.body.channel_id;
        
        // Permission check (duplicate pattern)
        if (!member?.permissions || !(BigInt(member.permissions) & PermissionFlagsBits.ManageRoles)) {
            return res.send({...}); // Identical error response
        }
        
        // Handler-specific logic (varies)
        const result = await someSpecificOperation(guildId, userId);
        
        // Response building (similar patterns)
        return res.send({
            type: InteractionResponseType.UPDATE_MESSAGE,
            data: {
                components: [...], // Similar component patterns
                flags: (1 << 15) // IS_COMPONENTS_V2
            }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        // Identical error handling
        console.error(`Error in ${custom_id} handler:`, error);
        return res.send({...}); // Identical error response
    }
}
```

**Factory Pattern Implementation:**
```javascript
// Enhanced buttonHandlerUtils.js:
export class ButtonHandlerFactory {
    static createHandler(config) {
        return async (req, res, client) => {
            try {
                // Automatic context extraction
                const context = this.extractContext(req);
                
                // Automatic permission checking
                if (config.requiresPermission && !this.checkPermission(context, config.requiredPermission)) {
                    return this.sendPermissionError(res, config.permissionMessage);
                }
                
                // Execute handler-specific logic
                const result = await config.handler(context, client);
                
                // Automatic response building
                return this.buildResponse(res, result, config.responseType);
            } catch (error) {
                return this.handleError(res, error, config.customId);
            }
        };
    }
}

// Usage in app.js:
const safariButtonHandler = ButtonHandlerFactory.createHandler({
    customId: 'safari_button_manage',
    requiresPermission: true,
    requiredPermission: PermissionFlagsBits.ManageRoles,
    responseType: 'UPDATE_MESSAGE',
    handler: async (context, client) => {
        // Only the unique logic for this specific handler
        return await safariManager.createManageInterface(context.guildId);
    }
});
```

**üèóÔ∏è Phase 2B: Response Builder Consolidation (500-800 lines saved)**
**Current Issue:** Discord response building is verbose and repetitive
**Solution:** Create standardized response builders

**Common Response Patterns:**
```javascript
// Components V2 Container Response (repeated 30+ times)
return res.send({
    type: InteractionResponseType.UPDATE_MESSAGE,
    data: {
        flags: (1 << 15), // IS_COMPONENTS_V2
        components: [{
            type: 17, // Container
            accent_color: 0xf39c12,
            components: [
                { type: 10, content: "Header text..." },
                { type: 1, components: [...buttons] }
            ]
        }]
    }
});

// Error Response (repeated 50+ times)
return res.send({
    type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
    data: {
        content: '‚ùå An error occurred. Please try again.',
        flags: InteractionResponseFlags.EPHEMERAL
    }
});
```

**Consolidated Response Builders:**
```javascript
// In responseBuilders.js:
export const ResponseBuilder = {
    componentsV2Container(content, buttons, accentColor = 0xf39c12) {
        return {
            type: InteractionResponseType.UPDATE_MESSAGE,
            data: {
                flags: (1 << 15),
                components: [{
                    type: 17,
                    accent_color: accentColor,
                    components: [
                        { type: 10, content },
                        { type: 1, components: buttons }
                    ]
                }]
            }
        };
    },
    
    error(message = '‚ùå An error occurred. Please try again.') {
        return {
            type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
            data: {
                content: message,
                flags: InteractionResponseFlags.EPHEMERAL
            }
        };
    }
};

// Usage: res.send(ResponseBuilder.componentsV2Container(content, buttons));
```

**Phase 2 Total Impact:**
- **Lines Reduced:** 3,000-4,000 lines (additional 21-28% reduction)
- **App.js Size:** ~9,000-8,000 lines (from original 14,000)
- **Code Quality:** Dramatically improved maintainability and consistency
- **Testing:** Requires comprehensive handler testing

### App.js Massive Code Reduction Initiative - Phase 3 (Major Extractions)
**Description:** Extract Safari system, modularize menu systems, and create modal utilities
**Target:** Final reduction of 3,500-4,500 lines to achieve target 2,000-3,000 line app.js
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (requires careful module boundaries and integration testing)
**Implementation Time:** 1 week after Phase 2 completion

**ü¶Å Phase 3A: Safari System Complete Extraction (2,500 lines saved)**
**Current State:** Safari handlers scattered throughout app.js (lines ~5,200-8,500)
**Target:** Move 95% of Safari functionality to enhanced `safariManager.js`

**Safari Handlers to Extract:**
```javascript
// Button management handlers (~800 lines)
safari_button_create, safari_button_edit_select, safari_button_manage_existing
safari_add_action_, safari_finish_button_, safari_edit_properties_

// Currency management handlers (~600 lines)  
safari_currency_set, safari_currency_reset, safari_currency_view_all

// Store management handlers (~700 lines)
safari_store_create, safari_store_edit, safari_item_add, safari_item_manage

// Dynamic execution handlers (~400 lines)
safari_{guildId}_{buttonId}_{timestamp} // Dynamic button clicks
```

**Enhanced safariManager.js Architecture:**
```javascript
// Comprehensive Safari system module:
export class SafariSystem {
    static async handleButtonManagement(context, action) { /* ... */ }
    static async handleCurrencyOperations(context, operation, data) { /* ... */ }
    static async handleStoreManagement(context, action, storeData) { /* ... */ }
    static async executeDynamicButton(context, buttonId, actionData) { /* ... */ }
}

// Clean app.js integration:
} else if (custom_id.startsWith('safari_')) {
    return await SafariSystem.routeHandler(req, res, client);
}
```

**üì± Phase 3B: Menu System Modularization (400-600 lines saved)**
**Current Issue:** Menu building functions are verbose with repeated component patterns
**Target:** Create reusable menu building system

**üóÇÔ∏è Phase 3C: Modal Utilities System (800-1,200 lines saved)**
**Current Issue:** Modal creation extremely verbose and repetitive
**Solution:** Universal modal factory system

**Common Modal Pattern (repeated 20+ times):**
```javascript
const modal = new ModalBuilder()
    .setCustomId(`some_modal_${id}`)
    .setTitle('Modal Title');

const input1 = new TextInputBuilder()
    .setCustomId('field1')
    .setLabel('Field 1')
    .setStyle(TextInputStyle.Short)
    .setRequired(true);

const input2 = new TextInputBuilder()
    .setCustomId('field2')
    .setLabel('Field 2')
    .setStyle(TextInputStyle.Paragraph)
    .setRequired(false);

modal.addComponents(
    new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(input1),
    new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(input2)
);
```

**Modal Factory System:**
```javascript
// In modalFactory.js:
export const ModalFactory = {
    create(config) {
        const modal = new ModalBuilder()
            .setCustomId(config.customId)
            .setTitle(config.title);
            
        const components = config.fields.map(field => 
            new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(
                new TextInputBuilder()
                    .setCustomId(field.id)
                    .setLabel(field.label)
                    .setStyle(field.multiline ? TextInputStyle.Paragraph : TextInputStyle.Short)
                    .setRequired(field.required || false)
                    .setPlaceholder(field.placeholder || '')
                    .setValue(field.value || '')
            )
        );
        
        return modal.addComponents(components.slice(0, 5)); // Discord limit
    }
};

// Usage:
const modal = ModalFactory.create({
    customId: 'safari_button_props',
    title: 'Edit Button Properties',
    fields: [
        { id: 'label', label: 'Button Label', required: true },
        { id: 'description', label: 'Description', multiline: true }
    ]
});
```

**Phase 3 Final Impact:**
- **Lines Reduced:** 3,500-4,500 lines (final 25-32% reduction)
- **Final app.js Size:** 2,000-3,000 lines (80-85% total reduction)
- **Architecture:** Fully modular, maintainable codebase
- **Performance:** Improved through reduced file size and better organization

**Complete Initiative Summary:**
```
Original app.js:     14,000 lines
Phase 1 (Quick):     -2,000 lines ‚Üí 12,000 lines  
Phase 2 (Handlers):  -3,500 lines ‚Üí 8,500 lines
Phase 3 (Major):     -4,000 lines ‚Üí 4,500 lines
Target Final:        2,000-3,000 lines (78-85% reduction)
```

**Implementation Order:**
1. **Phase 1:** Helper extraction + permission consolidation (3-4 days, minimal risk)
2. **Phase 2:** Button handler factory system (1 week, medium risk)  
3. **Phase 3:** Major system extractions (1 week, higher risk)

**Total Implementation Time:** 2-3 weeks for complete transformation
**Risk Mitigation:** Each phase independently testable with rollback capability

### CastBot Role Management System - Multi-Phase Implementation
**Description:** Comprehensive role management architecture for all role types that CastBot manages (pronouns, timezones, tribes, vanity roles)

**Current Problem:** Role management logic is scattered across multiple handlers with duplicated code, inconsistent patterns, and manual role hierarchy issues that prevent role assignment.

**Architecture Vision:** Unified `roleManager.js` module that provides centralized management for all CastBot role types with consistent storage patterns, validation, hierarchy checking, and assignment workflows.

**üîß PHASE 1: Setup System Refactor** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Scope:** Refactor setup button functionality with role hierarchy checking and improved user feedback
**Implementation:**
- Create `roleManager.js` module with setup functionality only
- Add role hierarchy validation (check if roles are above bot role in Discord hierarchy)
- Remove "subsequent run" detection (always show setup interface)
- Improve user feedback for different scenarios:
  - Role exists in Discord but not in CastBot ‚Üí Add to CastBot + hierarchy warning
  - Role already exists in CastBot ‚Üí Show as already configured  
  - Role doesn't exist ‚Üí Create new role
- Add new timezone roles: NDT (UTC-2:30, offset -2.5) and ADT (UTC-3, offset -3)
- Use Discord role tag syntax `<@&roleId>` for role mentions in setup feedback
- Design timezone data structure to support future daylight savings functionality

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Fix:** Address role hierarchy issue where existing pronoun/timezone roles above bot role cannot be assigned to users

**üîß PHASE 2: Pronoun & Timezone Management (FUTURE)**
**Scope:** Migrate all pronoun and timezone management to roleManager.js
- Extract STANDARD_PRONOUN_ROLES and STANDARD_TIMEZONE_ROLES constants
- Unified pronoun/timezone creation, addition, removal functions
- Consistent metadata storage and retrieval patterns
- Role validation and cleanup utilities

**üîß PHASE 3: Tribe Role Integration (FUTURE)**  
**Scope:** Integrate tribe role management into unified system
- Centralized tribe metadata management (colors, emojis, castlist assignment)
- Consistent tribe creation, modification, deletion workflows
- Enhanced tribe ordering and display options

**üîß PHASE 4: Vanity Role System (FUTURE)**
**Scope:** Complete vanity role management integration
- Streamlined vanity role assignment workflows
- Bulk vanity role operations
- Role conflict detection and resolution

**üîß PHASE 5: Advanced Role Features (FUTURE)**
**Scope:** Enhanced role management capabilities
- Automatic daylight savings time adjustment for timezone roles
- Role template system for quick server setup
- Role analytics and usage tracking
- Cross-server role configuration import/export

**‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (Phase 1) - ALL COMPLETE:**
- ‚úÖ `roleManager.js` module created with setup functionality
- ‚úÖ Role hierarchy checking prevents assignment failures  
- ‚úÖ Setup button provides clear feedback for all role scenarios
- ‚úÖ New timezone roles added: NDT (UTC-2:30) and ADT (UTC-3)
- ‚úÖ Discord role tag syntax used for role mentions (`<@&roleId>`)
- ‚úÖ Timezone data structure supports future DST functionality
- ‚úÖ Setup can be clicked repeatedly without creating duplicates
- ‚úÖ "Subsequent run" detection removed (always show setup interface)

**üìã Implementation Summary (Phase 1):**
- **Created:** `roleManager.js` module (629 lines) with comprehensive setup functionality
- **Eliminated:** ~320 lines of duplicated setup code from app.js (moved to centralized module)
- **Enhanced:** Setup user feedback with role hierarchy warnings and Discord tag syntax
- **Added:** NDT (UTC-2:30, offset -2.5) and ADT (UTC-3, offset -3) timezone roles
- **Implemented:** Role hierarchy checking with `checkRoleHierarchy()` function
- **Structured:** Timezone data for future DST support (dstObserved, standardName fields)
- **Simplified:** Setup UX - removed confusing "subsequent run" logic, always shows setup button

**üö® CRITICAL FIX: Discord Reaction Limits (Phase 1B):**
- **Discovered:** Discord has 20-reaction limit per message (50 for boosted servers)
- **Analyzed:** Current servers had 18+ timezone roles ‚Üí would break with user's +15 expansion
- **Optimized:** Curated 20 most essential timezone roles covering major global regions
- **Migrated:** Reaction functionality to `roleManager.js` with `REACTION_EMOJIS` constant
- **Fixed:** All 27 references to old `REACTION_NUMBERS` across app.js handlers
- **Enhanced:** Error messages now mention "Discord limits" for user clarity
- **Architecture:** Foundation ready for future boosted server detection (50-reaction support)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUTTON HANDLER DEPENDENCIES ANALYSIS - COMPLETED JANUARY 2025

**Analysis Request:** "Some of my buttons appear to call old /slash commands they were derived from. Can you do some deep thinking and analysis of the button event handlers, and if / how / what code they call, and whether any of it is any of the above code you flagged for removal."

**üö® IMMEDIATE ISSUE FIXED:**
- **Location:** Safari `safari_add_action_` handler (app.js:5622)
- **Issue:** `guildId is not defined` error when calling `listCustomButtons(guildId)`
- **Fix Applied:** Added `const guildId = req.body.guild_id;` to handler scope
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**üî¥ CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES DISCOVERED:**

**Button Handlers That Duplicate Slash Command Logic:**

1. **`prod_timezone_react` Handler (app.js:5803-5904)**
   - **Code Duplication:** 101 lines of IDENTICAL logic from `player_set_timezone` slash command
   - **Shared Functions:** `getGuildTimezones()`, reaction message creation, emoji mapping
   - **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CANNOT REMOVE `player_set_timezone` SLASH COMMAND** until this is refactored
   - **Refactoring Required:** Extract shared logic into utility function

2. **`prod_pronoun_react` Handler (app.js:5905-6002)**
   - **Code Duplication:** 97 lines of IDENTICAL logic from `player_set_pronouns` slash command  
   - **Shared Functions:** `getGuildPronouns()`, reaction message creation, emoji mapping
   - **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CANNOT REMOVE `player_set_pronouns` SLASH COMMAND** until this is refactored
   - **Refactoring Required:** Extract shared logic into utility function

**üü¢ SAFE BUTTON HANDLERS (No Dependencies):**
- **Safari System:** 15+ handlers (all independent, including dynamic safari buttons)
- **Production Menu:** 25+ handlers (admin_manage_*, prod_setup, etc.)
- **Castlist Navigation:** All Components V2 navigation handlers
- **Application System:** All application and ranking handlers
- **Player Management:** All modern playerManagement.js-based handlers

**üìä IMPACT SUMMARY:**

**Slash Commands That CANNOT Be Safely Removed:**
- `player_set_timezone` (~95 lines) - **BLOCKED by prod_timezone_react dependency**
- `player_set_pronouns` (~95 lines) - **BLOCKED by prod_pronoun_react dependency**

**Slash Commands Safe to Remove:** 14 of 16 flagged commands (~1,095 lines)
**Blocked by Dependencies:** 2 of 16 flagged commands (~190 lines)

**üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED REFACTORING PLAN:**

**Step 1: Extract Shared Logic**
```javascript
// Create new utility functions in storage.js or separate module:
async function createTimezoneReactionMessage(guildId, channelId, token)
async function createPronounReactionMessage(guildId, channelId, token)
```

**Step 2: Update Button Handlers**
- Replace duplicated code in `prod_timezone_react` with utility call
- Replace duplicated code in `prod_pronoun_react` with utility call
- Test both button handlers work identically to current behavior

**Step 3: Update Slash Commands**  
- Replace duplicated code in `player_set_timezone` with same utility call
- Replace duplicated code in `player_set_pronouns` with same utility call
- Verify identical functionality between slash commands and button handlers

**Step 4: Safe Removal**
- After refactoring, both slash command handlers can be safely removed
- Button handlers will continue working independently
- Total code removal: ~1,285 lines as originally planned

**üéØ CONCLUSION:**
The button handler dependency analysis reveals that 40+ button handlers are completely independent, but 2 critical button handlers (`prod_timezone_react` and `prod_pronoun_react`) contain identical duplicated code from their corresponding slash commands. These dependencies MUST be refactored before any slash command removal to prevent breaking functionality. The refactoring will actually improve code quality by eliminating the ~200 lines of duplicated logic while preserving all functionality.
